	abstract = {Congenital amusia is a neurodevelopmental disorder of music perception and production, which has been attributed to a major deficit in pitch processing. While most studies and diagnosis tests have used explicit investigation methods, recent studies using implicit investigation approaches have revealed some unimpaired pitch structure processing in congenital amusia. The present study investigated amusic individuals’ processing of tonal structures (e.g., musical structures respecting the Western tonal system) via three different questions. Amusic participants and their matched controls judged tonal versions (original musical excerpts) and atonal versions (with manipulated pitch content to remove tonal structures) of 12 musical pieces. For each piece, participants answered three questions that required judgments from different perspectives: an explicit structural one, a personal, emotional one and a more social one (judging the perception of others). Results revealed that amusic individuals’ judgments differed between tonal and atonal versions. However, the question type influenced the extent of the revealed structure processing: while amusic individuals were impaired for the question requiring explicit structural judgments, they performed as well as their matched controls for the two other questions. Together with other recent studies, these findings suggest that congenital amusia might be related to a disorder of the conscious access to music processing rather than music processing per se.},

They were concurrently exposed to either task-irrelevant harmonic music (judged to be consonant), task-irrelevant inharmonic music (judged to be dissonant), or no music at all as a distraction. The main finding across both experiments was that performance on the 2-back task was worse when participants were exposed to inharmonic music than when they were exposed to harmonic music. Interestingly, performance on the 2-back task was generally the same regardless of whether harmonic music or no music was played. We suggest that inharmonic, dissonant music interferes with cognitive performance by requiring greater cognitive processing than harmonic, consonant music, and speculate about why this might be.},

To be successful, it must be constrained by knowledge of phonological structure. Then, turning to the bona fide theory of innateness–the Principles and Parameters framework–I argue that a full explanation of children's grammar development must abandon the domain-specific learning model of triggering, in favor of probabilistic learning mechanisms that might be domain-general but nevertheless operate in the domain-specific space of syntactic parameters.},

We report an experiment that used sung materials and manipulated linguistic complexity (subject-extracted relative clauses, object-extracted relative clauses) and musical complexity (in-key critical note, out-of-key critical note, auditory anomaly on the critical note involving a loudness increase). The auditory-anomaly manipulation was included in order to test whether the difference between in-key and out-of-key conditions might be due to any salient, unexpected acoustic event. The critical dependent measure involved comprehension accuracies to questions about the propositional content of the sentences asked at the end of each trial. The results revealed an interaction between linguistic and musical complexity such that the difference between the subject- and object-extracted relative clause conditions was larger in the out-of-key condition than in the in-key and auditory-anomaly conditions. These results provide evidence for an overlap in structural processing between language and music.},

	abstract = {It is widely assumed that human learning and the structure of human languages are intimately related. This relationship is frequently suggested to derive from a language-specific biological endowment, which encodes universal, but communicatively arbitrary, principles of language structure (a Universal Grammar or UG). How might such a UG have evolved? We argue that UG could not have arisen either by biological adaptation or non-adaptationist genetic processes, resulting in a logical problem of language evolution. Specifically, as the processes of language change are much more rapid than processes of genetic change, language constitutes a "moving target" both over time and across different human populations, and, hence, cannot provide a stable environment to which language genes could have adapted. We conclude that a biologically determined UG is not evolutionarily viable. Instead, the original motivation for UG–the mesh between learners and languages–arises because language has been shaped to fit the human brain, rather than vice versa. Following Darwin, we view language itself as a complex and interdependent "organism," which evolves under selectional pressures from human learning and processing mechanisms. That is, languages themselves are shaped by severe selectional pressure from each generation of language users and learners. This suggests that apparently arbitrary aspects of linguistic structure may result from general learning and processing biases deriving from the structure of thought processes, perceptuo-motor factors, cognitive limitations, and pragmatics.},

	abstract = {Tonal music is a highly structured system that is ubiquitous in our cultural environment. We demonstrate the acquisition of implicit knowledge of tonal structure through neural self-organization resulting from mere exposure to simultaneous and sequential combinations of tones. In the process of learning, a network with fundamental neural constraints comes to internalize the essential correlational structure of tonal music. After learning, the network was run through a range of experiments from the literature. The model provides a parsimonious account of a variety of empirical findings dealing with the processing of tone, chord, and key relationships, including relatedness judgments, memory judgments, and expectancies. It also illustrates the plausibility of activation being a unifying mechanism underlying a range of cognitive tasks.},

Stemming from a different research tradition, studies on statistical learning carried out in the past 10 years after the seminal studies by Saffran and collaborators, appear to be closely related, and the similarity between the two approaches is strengthened further by their recent evolution. However, implicit learning and statistical learning research favor different interpretations, focusing on the formation of chunks and statistical computations, respectively. We examine these differing approaches and suggest that this divergence opens up a major theoretical challenge for future studies.},

	abstract = {The sound of music may arouse profound emotions in listeners. But such experiences seem to involve a 'paradox', namely that music - an abstract form of art, which appears removed from our concerns in everyday life - can arouse emotions - biologically evolved reactions related to human survival. How are these (seemingly) non-commensurable phenomena linked together? Key is to understand the processes through which sounds are imbued with meaning. It can be argued that the survival of our ancient ancestors depended on their ability to detect patterns in sounds, derive meaning from them, and adjust their behavior accordingly. Such an ecological perspective on sound and emotion forms the basis of a recent multi-level framework that aims to explain emotional responses to music in terms of a large set of psychological mechanisms. The goal of this review is to offer an updated and expanded version of the framework that can explain both 'everyday emotions' and 'aesthetic emotions'. The revised framework - referred to as BRECVEMA - includes eight mechanisms: Brain Stem Reflex, Rhythmic Entrainment, Evaluative Conditioning, Contagion, Visual Imagery, Episodic Memory, Musical Expectancy, and Aesthetic Judgment. In this review, it is argued that all of the above mechanisms may be directed at information that occurs in a 'musical event' (i.e., a specific constellation of music, listener, and context). Of particular significance is the addition of a mechanism corresponding to aesthetic judgments of the music, to better account for typical 'appreciation emotions' such as admiration and awe. Relationships between aesthetic judgments and other mechanisms are reviewed based on the revised framework. It is suggested that the framework may contribute to a long-needed reconciliation between previous approaches that have conceptualized music listeners' responses in terms of either 'everyday emotions' or 'aesthetic emotions'. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Perception of temporal patterns is fundamental to normal hearing, speech, motor control, and music. Certain types of pattern understanding are unique to humans, such as musical rhythm. Although human responses to musical rhythm are universal, there is much we do not understand about how rhythm is processed in the brain. Here, I consider findings from research into basic timing mechanisms and models through to the neuroscience of rhythm and meter. A network of neural areas, including motor regions, is regularly implicated in basic timing as well as processing of musical rhythm. However, fractionating the specific roles of individual areas in this network has remained a challenge. Distinctions in activity patterns appear between "automatic" and "cognitively controlled" timing processes, but the perception of musical rhythm requires features of both automatic and controlled processes. In addition, many experimental manipulations rely on participants directing their attention toward or away from certain stimulus features, and measuring corresponding differences in neural activity. Many temporal features, however, are implicitly processed whether attended to or not, making it difficult to create controlled baseline conditions for experimental comparisons. The variety of stimuli, paradigms, and definitions can further complicate comparisons across domains or methodologies. Despite these challenges, the high level of interest and multitude of methodological approaches from different cognitive domains (including music, language, and motor learning) have yielded new insights and hold promise for future progress.},

I demonstrate a context-free Lindenmayer system based on a group of operations, the Generalized Contextual Group (GCG), which abstracts and extends neo-Riemannian transformations. This Lindenmayer system is given commands representing operations from the GCG, as well as other operations on dimensions and quotients of chord space; these commands move a turtle, which represents several simultaneous voices of music, from one chord to another. A sequence of chords thus generated defines a score},

To do this, we first develop some theory of generalized interval systems: 1) we prove the well known fact that every pair of dual groups is isomorphic to the left and right regular representations of some group (Cayley's Theorem), 2) given a simply transitive group action, we show how to construct the dual group, and 3) given two dual groups, we show how to easily construct sub dual groups. Examples of this construction of sub dual groups include Cohn's hexatonic systems, as well as the octatonic systems. We then enumerate all Z\_\{12\}-subsets which are invariant under the triadic monoid and admit a simply transitive PLR-subgroup action on their maximal triadic covers. As a corollary, we realize all four hexatonic systems and all three octatonic systems as Lawvere–Tierney upgrades of consonant triads.},

Percentage of correct responses was analyzed in Experiment 1, and event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded in Experiments 2 and 3. Musicians performed better than nonmusicians in recognizing familiar musical phrases and classifying terminal notes. The differences found as a function of expertise were larger for unfamiliar than for familiar melodies. The ERPs to the end notes differed both in terms of amplitude and latency between musicians and nonmusicians, and as a function of participants' familiarity with the melodies and type of violation. Results show that expertise influences the decisional rather than the purely perceptual aspects of music processing and that ERPs can provide important insight into the study of music perception.},

More precisely, we construct the dual group to the permutation group acting on n-tuples with distinct entries, and prove that the dual group to permutations adjoined with a group G of invertible affine maps Z12 -{\textgreater} Z12 is the internal direct product of the dual to permutations and the dual to G.

A graph-theoretic approach proves useful in illustrating the symmetries inherent in parsimonious structures and modes of limited transposition. Four parsimonious graphs calles mode graphs are constructed. Each mode graph consists of several components, and the vertices in each of these components represent triads or seventh chords embedded in a particular mode of limited transposition. Two parsimonious methods of modulating between modes of limited transposition are explored, one by bridging and the other by coupling components of mode graphs. Bridging techniques of modulation lead to two tori, on for the triads and the other for seventh chords. In both tori, contextual transformations are evident in their structures, and the torus for triads is equivalent to the toroidal version of the Oettingen/Riemann Tonnetz. Coupling techniques of modulation lead to the graphs known as Cube Dance and Power Towers. Analytical implications of patterns of chord sequences embedded in parsimonious graphs are also discussed.},

	abstract = {Processing musical information is a task many of us perform effortlessly, and often, unconsciously. In order to gain a better understanding of this basic human cognitive ability, we propose a mathematical model for tonality, the underlying principles for tonal music. The model simultaneously incorporates pitch, interval, chord and key relations. It generates spatial counterparts for these musical entities by aggregating musical information. The model also serves as a framework on which to design algorithms that can mimic the human ability to organize musical input. One such skill is the ability to determine the key of a musical passage. This is equivalent to being able to pick out the most stable pitch in the passage, also known as “doh” in solfege. We propose a computational algorithm that mimics this human ability, and compare its performance to previous models. The algorithm is shown to predict the correct key with high accuracy. The proposed computational model serves as a research and pedagogical tool for putting forth and testing hypotheses about human perception and cognition in music. By designing efficient algorithms that mimic human cognitive abilities, we gain a better understanding of what it is that the human mind can do.},

The Spiral Array model is based on the Harmonic Network. The fundamental idea underlying the model is the representing of higher level objects in the spiral's interior as convex combinations of the representations of the representations of lower level components. By using the interior of the spiral, the original discrete space is relaxed to one that is continuous. Geometric mappings are demonstrated among Lerdahl's Tonal Pitch Space, Krumhansl's spatial representation of pitch relations and the Spiral Array model. The interior point approach of the Spiral Array model is shown to generate higher level structures that consistent with the results of these other approaches. The advantage of the interior point approach is that it facilitates comparisons across different hierarchical levels and problems that were previously combinatorial in nature and can be modelled more efficiently using the continuous space in the interior.},

	title = {Towards a {Mathematical} {Model} of {Tonality}},
	abstract = {This dissertation addresses the question of how musical pitches generate a tonal center. Being able to characterize the relationships that generate a tonal center is crucial to the computer analysis and the generating of western tonal music. It also can inform issues of compositional styles, structural boundaries, and performance decisions. The proposed Spiral Array model offers a parsimonious description of the inter-relations among tonal elements, and suggests new ways to re-conceptualize and reorganize musical information. The Spiral Array generates representations for pitches, intervals, chords and keys within a single spatial framework, allowing comparisons among elements from different hierarchical levels. Structurally, this spatial representation is a helical realization of the harmonic network (tonnetz). The basic idea behind the Spiral Array is the representation of higher level tonal elements as composites of their lower level parts. The Spiral Array assigns greatest prominence to perfect fifth and major/minor third interval relations, placing elements related by these intervals in proximity to each other. As a result, distances between tonal entities as represented spatially in the model correspond to perceived distances among sounding entities. The parameter values that affect proximity relations are prescribed based on a few perceived relations among pitches, intervals, chords and keys. This process of interfacing between the model and actual perception creates the opportunity to research some basic, but till now unanswered questions about the relationships that generate tonality. A generative model, the Spiral Array also provides a framework on which to design viable and effcient algorithms for problems in music cognition. I demonstrate its versatility by applying the model to three different problems: I develop an algorithm to determine the key of musical passages that, on average, performs better than existing ones when applied to the 24 fugue subjects in Book 1 of Bach's \{WTC;\} I propose the first computationally viable method for determining modulations (the change of key); and, I design a basic algorithm for finding the roots of chords, comparing its results to those of algorithms by other researchers. All three algorithms were implemented in Matlab.},

	abstract = {The `bootstrapping' to which the title of this paper refers was used metaphorically in 1984 by Diana Deutsch to describe simultaneous generation of more than one mental map, in which each perceptual schema somehow helps to co-generate the other. While Deutsch's attention was focused on `bootstraping' of tonal and event hierarchies, the term has been used more broadly to refer to other possible instances of co-generating mental representations; one example is seen in the proposition that metrical cues help to guide judgments of tonality, while tonal and harmonic cues simultaneously serve as metrical cues. This paper will make some connections among some of the theoretical and experimental literature contributed in the past decade; these connections seem to indicate that aural key recognition may be an elaborate example of this sort of co-generation. The most reasonable reaction to this literature may be to admit that although it is possible to arrange tonal pitch information within a fairly coherent hierarchy in the abstract, the perceptual activity of getting one's tonal bearings within that hierarchy may involve sampling idiosyncratically from several different levels within it. But it would be helpful first to review the literature leading up to these hunches.},

The solution method uses a noisy channel model implemented with weighted finitestate transducers. On a dataset of four works by Franz Schubert, our model predicted cycles in the same regions as cycles in the ground truth with a precision of 0.18 and a recall of 1.0. The recalled cycles had an average edit distance of 3.2 insertions or deletions from the ground truth cycles, which average 6.4 labeled triads in length.

	abstract = {Pitch relationships in music are characterized by their degree of consonance, a hierarchical perceptual quality that distinguishes how pleasant musical chords/intervals sound to the ear. The origins of consonance have been debated since the ancient Greeks. To elucidate the neurobiological mechanisms underlying these musical fundamentals, we recorded neuroelectric brain activity while participants listened passively to various chromatic musical intervals (simultaneously sounding pitches) varying in their perceptual pleasantness (i.e., consonance/dissonance). Dichotic presentation eliminated acoustic and peripheral contributions that often confound explanations of consonance. We found that neural representations for pitch in early human auditory cortex code perceptual features of musical consonance and follow a hierarchical organization according to music-theoretic principles. These neural correlates emerge pre-attentively within ∼150ms after the onset of pitch, are segregated topographically in superior temporal gyrus with a rightward hemispheric bias, and closely mirror listeners' behavioral valence preferences for the chromatic tone combinations inherent to music. A perceptual-based organization implies that parallel to the phonetic code for speech, elements of music are mapped within early cerebral structures according to higher-order, perceptual principles and the rules of Western harmony rather than simple acoustic attributes.},

	volume = {13},

	abstract = {The ability to appreciate most Western music presupposes cognitive structures capable of abstracting an underlying harmonic structure from a complex string of musical events. In this paper we provide a description of the listener’s knowledge of hierarchies of harmonic stability. The organization of harmonic information may be summarized by Osix principles. Three of these principles-Key Membership, Intrakey Distance and Intrakey Asymmetry-govern harmonic organization independent of context. Three principles-Contextual Identity, Contextual Distance and Contextual Asymmetry-govern harmonic organization in the presence of a tonal context. Chords that are members of the same key are represented in a hierarchy of stability that is independent of context. chords from different keys are represented in a hierarchy of stability that is dependent upon the prevailing context. Two different experimental tasks were used to provide convergent evidence for these principles: 1) multidimensional scaling of chords in the absence of any context or in the presence of different tonal contexts, and 2) recognition memory for chords in random and tonal contexts. It is suggested that harmonically stable chords function as cognitive reference points for the system as a whole. The importance of representations of hierarachies of harmonic stability is discussed with respect to generative accounts of musical competence.},

First, we deal with pitfalls in the selection of subjects, specifically focusing on the issue of contrasting more-experienced and less-experienced listeners. Next, we discuss some dilemmas with respect to the selection of stimuli. In particular, we compare the (dis) advantages of using real music stimuli with the (dis) advantages of artificial stimuli, distinguishing in the latter category between prototypical stimuli (e.g., chords or scale fragments) and tonally complex or even polytonal stimuli. Finally, we consider the (dis) advantages of various possible experimental paradigms, notably the production of a tonic and tonal center, the probe-tone paradigm, and tonality rating. For each of the three methodological subdomains, we propose recommendations for improvement.},

Here we argue that for cognition to be embodied and sometimes embedded, means that the cognitive faculty cannot be localized in a brain area alone. We review recent research on neural reuse, the 1/f structure of human activity, tool use, group cognition, and social coordination dynamics that we believe demonstrates how the boundary between the different areas of the brain, the brain and body, and the body and environment is not only blurred but indeterminate. In turn, we propose that cognition is supported by a nested structure of task-specific synergies, which are softly assembled from a variety of neural, bodily, and environmental components (including other individuals), and exhibit interaction dominant dynamics.},

@techreport{pardo_chordal_2002,
	title = {The chordal analysis of tonal music},
	abstract = {This paper provides a theoretical framework upon which to build a system for chordal analysis of music. We establish that, in the worst case, the partitioning and labeling of harmonies in tonal music is O(2N), where N is number of notes in a piece of music. We show that, when segments of the music can be analyzed locally, and a segment scoring metric can be found that is both additive and transitive, the problem becomes O(N2). Under these constraints, the problem is cast as finding the best path through a single- source directed acyclic graph, which can be solved in O(E + V) time. This translates to a worst-case time complexity of O(N2) for our problem. We then show that the results of the O(N2) search can be closely approximated through the use of a heuristic that allows O(N) time search. The results of the heuristic search are then compared to exhaustive graph search and the results of analyses by existing systems by Winograd (Winograd 1968), Maxwell (Maxwell 1992), and Temperley and Sleator (Temperley and Sleator 1999).},

Patel challenges the widespread belief that music and language are processed independently. Since Plato's time, the relationship between music and language has attracted interest and debate from a wide range of thinkers. Recently, scientific research on this topic has been growing rapidly, as scholars from diverse disciplines, including linguistics, cognitive science, music cognition, and neuroscience are drawn to the music-language interface as one way to explore the extent to which different mental abilities are processed by separate brain mechanisms. Accordingly, the relevant data and theories have been spread across a range of disciplines. This volume provides the first synthesis, arguing that music and language share deep and critical connections, and that comparative research provides a powerful way to study the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying these uniquely human abilities.

	abstract = {Neo-Riemannian theory developed as the mathematical analysis of musical trends dating as far back as the late 19th century. Specically, the musical trends at hand involved the use of unorthodox sets of pitches. These sets had the characteristic of retaining their triadic harmonies, but of sounding atonal. Neo-Riemannian theory not only allowed for the mathematical construction and description of these sets, some of which later were called the Hexatonic Systems, but also a means to explain how these systems were used. Involving the application of the P LR Operations, the analysis of the Hexatonic Systems is a primary component of neo-Riemannian theory. In this paper, I give a self-contained description of Rick Cohn's Hexatonic Systems, as well as the group-theoretic structures at hand.},

	abstract = {Through the application of algebraic combinatorics on words to the study of diatonic modes the paper characterizes the ascending authentic Ionian mode among the others in terms of divider incidence. This property characterizes positive standard words among their conjugates with respect to plain adjointness. The plain adjoint of the Ionian step-interval pattern aaba{\textbar}aab is the Ionian fifth-up/fourth-down folding pattern yx{\textbar}yxyxy. Three different kinds of mathematical objects are associated with one another: affine automorphisms of Z\_n, trajectories \{\vphantom{\}}0, ..., n] –{\textgreater} Z x Z traversing lifts of the graphs of affine automorphisms to fundamental domains of Z\_n x Z\_n within Z x Z, and well-formed words encoding the zigzag patterns of the trajectories in terms of binary words. Inversion of affine automorphisms is thereby associated with an extension of the duality of Christoffel words to their conjugates. Plain adjointness for positive standard words has a transformational expression in terms of the monoid-anti-automorphism of the special standard monoid. Positive standard words are images of the word ab unter special standard morphisms f e (G, D). Plain adjointness corresponds to the reversal of the order of f. The factorization of f(ab) into the two factors f(a) and f(b) coincides with the authentic division.}

Fred Lehrdahl (2001) uses the attribute "well-formed" (in extension of the TGTTM tradition) in order to formulate constraints for the constitution of the basic space as a context-sensitive stratification of the chromatic pitches into layers. The appearance of pitch hierarchies is common to both approaches and thus provides a starting point for the discussion. There are two other theoretical aspects, which motivate the comparison between the two approaches: (a) the distinction between generic and specific intervals and (b) the duality between step interval patterns and fifth/fourth foldings in the theory of well-formed modes.},

First, a quick overview of our mathematical systematization for similarity measures, including data transformations and calculation methods is given. Behavioral data from three listener experiments is used to model experts’ similarity judgments of short melodies from popular music in different contextual situations. A weighted combination of several similarity measures, representing two resp. three different sources of information, is found to explain user ratings best. As an application example one of the optimal similarity measures resulting from these three experiments is used to analyze a body of about 600 folk melodies from Luxembourg. Finally, the expert classification of the individual phrases of these melodies that has carried out in an extensive ethno-musicological study (Sagrillo, 1999) is reconstructed with the help of an optimal combination of similarity measures using logistic regression.},

	abstract = {The leitmotives in Richard Wagner’s Der Ring des Nibelungen serve a range of compositional and psychological functions, including the introduction of musical structure and mnemonic devices for the listener. Leitmotives in the Ring differ greatly in their construction, salient aspects (e.g. rhythmic, melodic, harmonic), and their usage in particular scenes and contexts. We aim to understand listeners’ real-time processing of leitmotives, and have gathered data from a memory test, probing participants’ memory for different leit- motives contained in a 10-minute excerpt from the opera Siegfried. An item response theory (IRT) approach was used to estimate item difficulty parameters as well as parameters characterizing participants’ individual recognition ability. We fit a series of IRT models to the data obtained from 68 participants, finding that a Rasch Model with an unconstrained but fixed discrimination parameter fit the data best accord- ing to the Bayesian Information Criterion. We further investigated the relationship between model parameters and factors such as: number of leitmotive occurrences in the excerpt; acoustical distance using chroma features (Mauch \& Dixon, 2010) and distance thresholding (Casey, Rhodes \& Slaney, 2008); extent of musical training; and objective and self-reported Wagner expertise, finding that performance in the objective Wagner test and chroma distance were statistically significant predictors, while number of occurrences, self-reported Wagner expertise and extent of musical training did not reach significance.},

	url = {http://ojs.gold.ac.uk/index.php/sysmus14/article/view/243},
	abstract = {The subject of this paper is the cognition of triadic progressions in 19th century tonal music. Music psychological research concerning the cognition of harmonic progressions mainly relies on diatonic music in which triads are easily relatable to a key. Triadic distance is therefore measured in terms of root relationships to the tonal center, the tonic (Krumhansl \&amp; Kessler, 1982). This conception is not directly applicable to chromatic music where musical coherence is not only obtained by common a key. Transformational music theory puts strong emphasis on voice-leading parsimony as a measure of distance. The most efficient transformations between major and minor triads are P (parallel), R (relative) and L (leading-tone exchange), which is also in accordance with empirical findings of diatonic triadic relatedness (Krumhansl, 1998). Notably, P and R generate an octatonic scale containing eight major and minor triads which are claimed to be functionally equivalent. Transformational analyses result in sequential patterns of triadic progressions and an overarching key is not required. Based on an extended notion of function and acknowledging that there are compelling arguments for both hierarchical and sequential representations of the cognition of harmonic progressions a multi-level model is proposed that combines both approaches, adopting features of the generative model by Rohrmeier (2011). The two main components of the model are the concept of functional equivalence and the distinction between the hierarchic-syntactic cognition of functional progressions and the schematic cognition of functional values.},

The 31 subjects’ experimen- tal task was to sing back a novel melody presented either as single note MIDI melody or as the vocal melodies in audio excerpts from real pop songs. Each subject was tested with 14 different melodies and could use up to 6 tri- als for each melody. The aim of the data analysis was to predict the similarity between the original melody and the sung recalls by the subjects. The similarity was measured with different algorithmic measures reflecting various structural aspects of melodies, e.g. melodic contour, inter- vals, rhythm, or melodic accents. Among the results of the data analysis are the descriptions of different learning curves for the different structural aspects over trials, and the general importance or persistence of the different musi- cal dimensions in memory. Although the study was carried out with 31 subjects due to the very time consuming proc- ess of transcription of the subjects’ sung recalls, the pre- liminary data analysis presented in ties paper is based solely on 10 subjects.},

	abstract = {Bilinguals and musicians exhibit behavioral advantages on tasks with high demands on executive functioning, particularly inhibitory control, but the brain mechanisms supporting these differences are unclear. Of key interest is whether these forms of experience influence cognition through similar or distinct information processing mechanisms. Here, we recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) in three groups - bilinguals, musicians, and controls - who completed a visual go-nogo task that involved the withholding of key presses to rare targets. Participants in each group achieved similar accuracy rates and responses times but the analysis of cortical responses revealed significant differences in ERP waveforms. Success in withholding a prepotent response was associated with enhanced stimulus-locked N2 and P3 wave amplitude relative to go trials. For nogo trials, there were altered timing-specific ERP differences and graded amplitude differences observed in the neural responses across groups. Specifically, musicians showed an enhanced early P2 response accompanied by reduced N2 amplitude whereas bilinguals showed increased N2 amplitude coupled with an increased late positivity wave relative to controls. These findings demonstrate that bilingualism and music training have differential effects on the brain networks supporting executive control over behavior.},

We examine how embodiment is used in social psychology, and we explore the ways in which embodied approaches enrich traditional theories. Although research in this area is burgeoning, much of it has been more descriptive than explanatory. We provide a critical discussion of the trajectory of embodiment research in social psychology. We contend that future researchers should engage in a phenomenon-based approach, highlight the theoretical boundary conditions and mediators involved, explore novel action-relevant outcome measures, and address the role of individual differences broadly defined. Such research will likely provide a more explanatory account of the role of embodiment in general terms as well as how it expands the knowledge base in social psychology.},

In the first case, empirical results do not unequivocally support the principle, but it continues to be used by musicologists. In the second, mathematical and computational approaches are found to differ significantly from those of music analysis in their purpose and effect. Other differences between the disciplines are examined in the use of metaphor in musical discourse, and misunderstandings over the role of abstraction and estimation. Throughout, human factors are found to confound proper communication.

The ratings depend on the hier- archic implementation of three primary factors–stability, proximity, and direction–and one secondary factor–mobility. The model explicitly links expectancy ratings to aspects of listeners’ experiences of tension in melody. An approach to temporal expectations is discussed but not quantified. The model is situated within a framework for thinking about a type of schematic melodic expectations. This article assesses the position of these expectations within the broader cognitive processes invoked in lis- tening to music. It suggests methods for investigating the expectations empirically. Additionally, it outlines connections between the theorized expectations and the dynamic, affective contours of musical experience.},

Listeners rated how well single tones (any one of the 12 tones of the chromatic scale) followed a musical element such as a scale, chord, or cadence. Stable rating profiles reflecting the tonal hierarchies in major and minor keys were obtained, which, when intercorrelated and analyzed using multidimensional scaling, produced a 4-dimensional spatial map of the distances between keys. Listeners integrated harmonic functions over multiple chords, developing a sense of key that needed to be re-evaluated as additional chords were sounded. It is suggested that the perceived relations between chords and keys and between different keys are mediated through an internal representation of the hierarchy of tonal functions of single tones in music.

	abstract = {Two experiments provide convergent evidence for the hypothesis that listeners interpret chords in terms of their harmonic functions in a system of interrelated keys. The perceived associations between chords undergo significant changes dependingonthe broader tonal frame- work in which they are embedded. Three independent context effects are identified, and their magnitude is found to be a systematic function ofthe distance between the context key and the key (or keys) of which the chords are members. In the first experiment, listeners rate how musically related one chord is to a second chord; the chords are those that function within two maximally distant major keys (Cmajor and F\# major).All possible chord pairs from this set are presented in each ofthree context keys: G major (whichis close to C major and distant from F\# major), A major (whichis moderately distant from both C major and F\# major), and B major (whichis closeto F\# major and distantfrom Cmajor).The second experiment measures recogni- tion memory for the same chords embedded in tonal sequences in C, G, A, or B major keys, or random sequences. In the twoexperiments, the distance between the contextkey and the key of the chords on the circle-of-fifths affects: (1) the probability that a repeated chord is correctly recognized, (2) the strength ofassociation between chords from the same key measured in terms ofboth confusion errors and direct relatedness judgments, and (3) asymmetries in confusion er- rors and relatedness judgments when the chords are in different keys. Perceived harmonic rela- tions are thus found to be strongly context dependent, but the context effects are lawful func- tions of interkey distance. We conclude that listeners possess a highly articulated system of knowledge about the harmonic functions of chords in musical keys and an appreciation of musical structureat the levelofabstract tonal centers.},

	abstract = {Four issues raised by Butler's (1989) commentary are addressed. The first issue is the possibility that the results of perceptual studies of tonal hier- archies can be attributed to task-specific strategies developed in response to particular stimuli. Such strategies cannot account for the convergence across experiments employing varied tasks and stimulus materials. The second issue is the correspondence between statistical summaries of mu- sic and perceptual data. The correspondence is shown to be quite general and to have implications for the acquisition of tonal knowledge. The third issue is the process listeners use to identify the tonal center. Pattern- matching to tonal hierarchies is shown to be a plausible process contrib- uting to key-finding, whereas a tritone rule has limited applicability. The final issue is the effect of temporal order on pitch perception. Principled temporal-order effects are found in many psychological experiments, but not in those focusing on the tritone relation.},

It begins by defining those elements that appear in the models in the three papers that follow. A brief review is given of psychological results demonstrating that these music-theoretic definitions describe implicit knowledge that listeners have of tonal-harmonic music. This is followed by a brief historical summary of maps that were proposed previously of keys, tones, and chords, and a hybrid tone-chord map. The article then summarizes a number of issues that arise in connection with geometric representations. Finally, the innovations in the three proposed models are highlighted, particularly their contributions to visualizing the dynamics and temporal relationships that exist in extended musical pieces.},

Th\& separation of chords unique to the keys and the multiple functions of chords shared by the different keys were simultaneously represented. A regular pattern of asymmetries was also found that suggests a hierarchy among different types of chords. In addition, there was a preference for sequences ending on chords central to the prevailing tonality.

Three properties of musical schema are evaluated in a recognition memory experi- ment: (1)The schema engages a subset of the abstract knowledge system that is determined by the predominant key of the musical sequence, (2)the schema evaluates both interval relations and the functions of the sounded elements within the established tonal framework, and (3)the schema interacts continuously with the musical event in time to process pitch information in its temporal context. Listeners are required to identify the serial position ofa chord that is changed between two successive chord sequences that are otherwise identical. The experiment measures the magnitude and the temporal extent of the disruptive effect of including in the sequence an element outside the tonal framework. The results show temporally specific effects on memory for pitch relations consistent with the operation of a musical schema. Comparisons are made with schema-based theories applied in other perceptual and cognitive domains.},

We compared processing of semantic meaning in language and music, investigating the semantic priming effect as indexed by behavioral measures and by the N400 component of the event-related brain potential (ERP) measured by electroencephalography (EEG). Human subjects were presented visually with target words after hearing either a spoken sentence or a musical excerpt. Target words that were semantically unrelated to prime sentences elicited a larger N400 than did target words that were preceded by semantically related sentences. In addition, target words that were preceded by semantically unrelated musical primes showed a similar N400 effect, as compared to target words preceded by related musical primes. The N400 priming effect did not differ between language and music with respect to time course, strength or neural generators. Our results indicate that both music and language can prime the meaning of a word, and that music can, as language, determine physiological indices of semantic processing.},

Only recently, the necessary conditions of commutativity and multiplicativity have been formulated (Narens, 1996, Journal of Mathematical Psychology) and tested empirically, e.g., for the sensation of loudness. The present investigation evaluated these properties for the ratio production of pitch intervals. Musically trained (n = 10) and untrained (n = 11) participants adjusted intervals defined by two ascending pure-tone frequencies to given fractions (1/3, 1/2, 2/3), starting either from a 12 or 17-semitone standard pitch interval. The results show that the axioms of commutativity and multiplicativity held for most of the participants, irrespective of musical training. Furthermore, all participants produced larger frequency intervals in response to larger ratio numbers used in the instructions (monotonicity), but only musically trained participants were sensitive to the size of the standard interval (thus producing strictly increasing magnitudes). Overall, the results indicate that pitch intervals are ratio-scalable. However, restrictions must be made, especially for non-musical listeners, and when an octave is exceeded.},

One view, which I will label body functionalism, takes the body to play the functional role of linking external resources for problem solving with internal biological machinery. Embodiment is thus understood in terms of the role the body plays in supporting the computational circuits that realize cognition. Body enactivism argues by contrast that no computational account of cognition can account for the role of commonsense knowledge in our everyday practical engagement with the world.

However, previous studies have argued against the perception of such structures in music. Here, we show processing of nonlocal dependencies in music. We presented chorales by J. S. Bach and modified versions in which the hierarchical structure was rendered irregular whereas the local structure was kept intact. Brain electric responses differed between regular and irregular hierarchical structures, in both musicians and nonmusicians. This finding indicates that, when listening to music, humans apply cognitive processes that are capable of dealing with long-distance dependencies resulting from hierarchically organized syntactic structures. Our results reveal that a brain mechanism fundamental for syntactic processing is engaged during the perception of music, indicating that processing of hierarchical structure with nested nonlocal dependencies is not just a key component of human language, but a multidomain capacity of human cognition.},

Theories of embodied cognition provide a structure within which we can investigate the mechanisms underlying action's impact on thinking and reasoning.

	doi = {10.1525/mts.1985.7.1.02a00120},
	abstract = {All formal differences between language and music are a consequence of differences in their fundamental building blocks (arbitrary pairings of sound and meaning in the case of language; pitch-classes and pitch-class combinations in the case of music). In all other respects, language and music are identical. In particular, we argue, developing but also extending earlier proposals by Lerdahl and Jackendoff (1983), that music, like language, contains a syntactic component in which headed structures are built by iterated, recursive, binary Merge. This is the component that Lerdahl and Jackendoff called Prolongational Reduction, which represents hierarchical patterns of tension and relaxation in tonal harmony. We further argue that the distinct component that Lerdahl and Jackendoff called Time Span Reduction is a musical prosodic component (a point anticipated by Lerdahl and Jackendoff themselves) – whose interface with the syntactic component is strikingly similar to the comparable interface between syntactic and prosodic structure in language. Though our discussion takes Lerdahl and Jackendoff's work as a starting point and touchstone throughout, our proposals also constitute a significant realignment of their model – necessary in order to reveal similarities between musical and linguistic structure that were not evident in their presentation. This realignment also reflects a distinction in goals between our proposal and theirs. Their work took as its starting point the question "Given a piece of music in a particular musical idiom I, what laws govern the class of analyses that a listener assigns to it in I?" Our proposals arise from a related but distinct question, more typical of generative linguistic work: "What general laws define the class of possible pieces in I?" That is, what is the grammar of I? Our realignment of Lerdahl and Jackendoff's proposals in light of the Identity Thesis allows us to ask questions not taken up in their work. For example, does Internal Merge (i.e. syntactic movement) apply in the construction of musical syntactic structure, in addition to External Merge? We argue that the phenomenon of cadence is an instance of exactly this: head-movement from the penultimate constituent of a musical passage (the dominant) to the final tonic chord. Finally, we argue that the output of musical syntax feeds a Tonal-Harmonic Component whose formal relation to the music syntax strongly resembles the relation between linguistic syntax and the semantic system that interacts with it – and is subject to a Principle of Full Interpretation with respect to that component.},

	abstract = {Information processing researchers have assumed that algebra symbol skills depend on mastery of the abstract rules presented in the curriculum (Matz, 1980; Sleeman, 1986). Thus, students' ubiquitous algebra errors have been taken as indicating the need to embed algebra in rich contextual settings (Kaput, 1995; National Council of Teachers of Mathematics [NCTM] Algebra Working Group, 1998). This study explored a nonrepresentational account of symbolic algebra skills as feature corre- lation within the visual field. We present evidence that algebra students respond spon- taneously to the visual patterns of the notational display apart from engagement with the declarative content of the rules. Thus, persistent algebra errors may reflect disen- gagement from declarative content rather than an inability to deal with it. We sketch a Lexical Support System designed to sustain students' engagement with the declar- ative content of algebraic rules and processes, thus complementing the exciting curricular possibilities being developed for referentially rich algebra},

	title = {Permutation groups and tesselations},
	abstract = {Analytical approaches to musical analysis have generally attempted to provide some kind of justification, and, in the last decades, to develop analytical elements based on tesselations of pitch class sets. When applied to atonal music, analytical approaches frequently fail to find internal coherence. Most of the time, tilings of chords are based on a torus representation, which follows the traditional principles of functional harmonic progression. A possible solution for determining a nice coherence of atonal chords progression is dependent on the topology of the tesselation involved. In the first section, we show that some tilings of chords could be related to the Klein bottle or to the projective plane. It is well known that tesselations are connected with groups. Consequently, possibilities of musical analyses can be suggested through a theoretical group approach. In the second section, we consider the neo-Riemannian theory, and suggest a number of revisions. We substitute the contextual transformations by three pointwise operations based on permutations, in order to link harmonic hierarchical or categorized structures with permutation groups. In the last section, we draw upon Olivier Messiaen’s works in order to show that some groups are more suitable than others for analytical approaches, but in any case, are related to some permutation groups.},

Within the same set of consistently activated voxels, the topography of tonality selectivity rearranged itself across scanning sessions.

Although it has been argued that we will never know how cognitive traits evolved (Lewontin, 1998), we argue that we may know the evolution of music by investigating the fundamental cognitive mechanisms of musicality, for example, relative pitch, tonal encoding of pitch, and beat induction. In addition, we show that a nomological network of evidence (Schmitt \& Pilcher, 2004) can be built around the hypothesis that musicality is a cognitive adaptation. Within this network, different modes of evidence are gathered to support a specific evolutionary hypothesis. We show that the combination of psychological, medical, physiological, genetic, phylogenetic, hunter-gatherer, and cross-cultural evidence indicates that musicality is a cognitive adaptation.},

	abstract = {In the past, notions of embodiment have been applied to robotics mainly in the realm of very simple robots, and supporting low-level mechanisms such as dynamics and navigation. In contrast, most human-like, interactive, and socially adept robotic systems turn away from embodiment and use amodal, symbolic, and modular approaches to cognition and interaction. At the same time, recent research in Embodied Cognition (EC) is spanning an increasing number of complex cognitive processes, including language, nonverbal communication, learning, and social behavior. This article suggests adopting a modern EC approach for autonomous robots interacting with humans. In particular, we present three core principles from EC that may be applicable to such robots: (a) modal perceptual representation, (b) action/perception and action/cognition integration, and (c) a simulation-based model of top-down perceptual biasing. We describe a computational framework based on these principles, and its implementation on two physical robots. This could provide a new paradigm for embodied human-robot interaction based on recent psychological and neurological findings.},

	abstract = {Elements of Sonata Theory is a comprehensive, richly detailed rethinking of the basic principles of sonata form in the decades around 1800. This foundational study draws upon the joint strengths of current music history and music theory to outline a new, up-to-date paradigm for understanding the compositional choices found in the instrumental works of Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, and their contemporaries: sonatas, chamber music, symphonies, overtures, and concertos. In so doing, it also lays out the indispensable groundwork for anyone wishing to confront the later adaptations and deformations of these basic structures in the nineteenth and earlier twentieth centuries. Combining insightful music analysis, contemporary genre theory, and provocative hermeneutic turns, the book brims over with original ideas, bold and fresh ways of awakening the potential meanings within a familiar musical repertory. Sonata Theory grasps individual compositions-and each of the individual moments within them-as creative dialogues with an implicit conceptual background of flexible, ever-changing historical norms and patterns. These norms may be recreated as constellations "compositional defaults," any of which, however, may be stretched, strained, or overridden altogether for individualized structural or expressive purposes. This book maps out the terrain of that conceptual background, against which what actually happens-or does not happen-in any given piece may be assessed and measured. The Elements guides the reader through the standard (and less-than-standard) formatting possibilities within each compositional space in sonata form, while also emphasizing the fundamental role played by processes of large-scale circularity, or "rotation," in the crucially important ordering of musical modules over an entire movement. The book also illuminates new ways of understanding codas and introductions, of confronting the generating processes of minor-mode sonatas, and of grasping the arcs of multimovement cycles as wholes. Its final chapters provide individual studies of alternative sonata types, including "binary" sonata structures, sonata-rondos, and the "first-movement form" of Mozart's concertos.},

	abstract = {Hegels Kunstbegriff wird aus dem Zentrum seines Philosophierens, d. h. aus der Logik entwickelt. Es zeigt sich erstens, daß Hegels Philosophie nicht thetisch ist, weil sie ein selbst standpunktloses Durchlaufen von Standpunkten ist, in dessen Verlauf das Denken jeweils in grundsätzlich verschiedener Weise zum Stehen kommt (Seins-, Wesens- Begriffslogik). Thematisch wird dies in Hegels Auffassung des Seins als eines Momentes am Übergang von Seins- zu Wesenslogik. Insofern das Sein ein Moment, d. h. Begriffsmoment des Wesens ist, ist es aus dem Wesen ableitbar, welches selbst folglich jenseits von Sein und Nicht-Sein gedacht werden muß. Die genaue Rekonstruktion dieses Zusammenhangs erlaubt es, die Frage nach dem Verhältnis Logik-Realphilosophie (Entschluß der Idee) in einer Weise zu lösen, die zugleich sichtbar macht, auf welche Frage eigentlich Hegel mit diesem und verwandten Theoriestücken (z. B.: ontologischer Beweis) antwortet. Es zeigt sich, daß er äuß erst radikal die Fragestellung selbst verlagert. Auf dieser Grundlage wird ferner der Freiheitsbegriff Hegels neu gefaß t, und zwar besonders im Hinblick auf seine verdeckte, aber allesentscheidende Funktion in der Dialektik der Idee des Guten. Freiheit ist noch etwas anderes als Autonomie, Sich-Wiederfinden im Anderen usw. Sie tritt in der Dialektik des Guten als Mittelbegriff einer logischen (d. h. notwendigen) Vermittlung auf und erweist so ihre Irreduktibilität. Dies gibt Anlaß zu einer Reinterpretation der Hegelschen Religionsphilosophie. Weder Apologie der bestehenden Religionen noch agnostische Kritik, zeigt sich "das Religiöse" vielmehr als der Grundzug einer gewissen Form der Menschlichkeit, in Bezug auf die die Frage erörtert wird, bis zu welchem Grade sie etwa datiert ("überholt") sei.},

With this grammar an automatic harmonic analysis of a sequence of symbolic chord labels is obtained in the form of a parse tree. The harmonic similarity is determined by finding and examining the largest labeled common embeddable subtree (LLCES) of two parse trees. For the calculation of the LLCES a new O(min(n,m)nm) time algorithm is presented, where n and m are the sizes of the trees. For the analysis of the LLCES we propose six distance measures that exploit several structural characteristics of the Combined LLCES. We demonstrate in a retrieval experiment that at least one of these new methods significantly outperforms a baseline string matching approach and thereby show that using additional musical knowledge from music cognitive and music theoretic models actually helps improving retrieval performance.},

Both the direct and indirect tests were sensitive to knowledge of chunks. However, only the indirect test was sensitive to knowledge of the inversion rule.

The notions of «predicative thinking» versus «functional thinking» describe a cognitive pattern that tries to explain the preference or even special capability for either one of the two view points. Meanwhile, there are not only numerous qualitative experimental results that prove the usefulness of this theoretical construct, but also an EEG-study and several studies involving eye-movement analysis that emphasise quantitative evidence. As aspects of predicative thinking have been studied quite frequently in cognitive psychology, there is an accumulated need for studies of functional thinking. Primary school education shows that functional approaches have been neglected in spite of advocates of the operational principle. Anyhow, there are didactical materials like the Addition-, Multiplication-Landscape, the spiral staircase for calculating or the Dynamic Labyrinths that are very well suited to demand and promote functional thinking.},

We report here a follow-up experiment investigating the relationship between body size, performance on motor tasks, and PBP, and possible mediating effects of musicality and mood state. 40 subjects completed a mixed design experiment, incorporating anthropometric measurements, motor tasks (walking and tapping, estimating preferred step period and spontaneous inter-tap interval respectively), psychometric tests of mood, and a measure of musicality, alongside the perceptual paradigm estimating PBP used by Todd et al. (2007). Using a variety of methods of statistical analysis, we found some evidence of a positive relationship between (some) anthropometric variables and both preferred step period and PBP, as predicted, as well as suggestive evidence of effects of musicality and mood variables.},

This paper reports an experiment combining the methodology of artificial grammar learning with musical acquisition of melodic structure. Participants acquired knowledge of grammatical melodic structures under incidental learning conditions in both experimental and untrained control conditions. Subsequent analysis indicates a large effect of unsupervised online learning in the experimental and control group throughout the course of the testing phase suggesting an effective ongoing learning process. Musicians did not outperform nonmusicians, indicating that musical expertise is not advantageous for the learning of a new, unfamiliar melodic system.

	abstract = {Context-free grammars are fundamental for the description of linguistic syntax. However, most artificial grammar learning experiments have explored learning of simpler finite-state grammars, while studies exploring context-free grammars have not assessed awareness and implicitness. This paper explores the implicit learning of context-free grammars employing features of hierarchical organization, recursive embedding and long-distance dependencies. The grammars also featured the distinction between left- and right-branching structures, as well as between centre- and tail-embedding, both distinctions found in natural languages. People acquired unconscious knowledge of relations between grammatical classes even for dependencies over long distances, in ways that went beyond learning simpler relations (e.g. n-grams) between individual words. The structural distinctions drawn from linguistics also proved important as performance was greater for tail-embedding than centre-embedding structures. The results suggest the plausibility of implicit learning of complex context-free structures, which model some features of natural languages. They support the relevance of artificial grammar learning for probing mechanisms of language learning and challenge existing theories and computational models of implicit learning.},

We review the scope and limits of theoretical accounts of musical prediction with respect to feature-based and temporal prediction. While the concept of prediction is unproblematic for basic single-stream features such as melody, it is not straight-forward for polyphonic structures or higher-order features such as formal predictions. Behavioural results based on explicit and implicit (priming) paradigms provide evidence of priming in various domains that may reflect predictive behaviour. Computational learning models, including symbolic (fragment-based), probabilistic/graphical, or connectionist approaches, provide well-specified predictive models of specific features and feature combinations. While models match some experimental results, full-fledged music prediction cannot yet be modelled. Neuroscientific results regarding the early right-anterior negativity (ERAN) and mismatch negativity (MMN) reflect expectancy violations on different levels of processing complexity, and provide some neural evidence for different predictive mechanisms. At present, the combinations of neural and computational modelling methodologies are at early stages and require further research.},

	abstract = {This study aims to contribute empirical computational results to the understanding of tonality and harmonic structure. It analyses aspects of tonal harmony and harmonic patterns based on a statistical, computational corpus analysis of Bach’s chorales. This is carried out using a novel heuristic method of segmentation developed specifically for that purpose. Analyses of distributions of single pc sets, chord classes and pc set transitions reveal very different structural patterns in both modes, many, but not all of which accord with standard music theory. In addition, most frequent chord transitions are found to exhibit a large degree of asymmetry, or, directedness, in way that for two pc sets A,B the transition frequencies f(A→B) and f(B→A) may differ to a large extent. Distributions of unigrams and bigrams are found to follow a Zipf distribution, i.e. decay in frequency roughly according to 1/x2 which implies that the majority of the musical structure is governed by a few frequent elements. The findings provide evidence for an underlying harmonic syntax which results in distinct statistical patterns. A subsequent respective antecedent and consequent hierarchical cluster analysis of pc sets based on patterns finds that this information suffices to group chords into meaningful functional groups solely on intrinsic statistical grounds without regard to pitch content.},

Findings of above-chance performance of some untrained control groups in artificial grammar learning studies raise questions about the extent to which learning can occur in an untrained, unsupervised testing situation with both correct and incorrect structures. The plausibility of unsupervised online-learning effects was modelled with n-gram, chunking and simple recurrent network models. A novel evaluation framework was applied, which alternates forced binary grammaticality judgments and subsequent learning of the same stimulus. Our results indicate a strong online learning effect for n-gram and chunking models and a weaker effect for simple recurrent network models. Such findings suggest that online learning is a plausible effect of statistical chunk learning that is possible when ungrammatical sequences contain a large proportion of grammatical chunks. Such common effects of continuous statistical learning may underlie statistical and implicit learning paradigms and raise implications for study design and testing methodologies.},

	abstract = {Musical knowledge, like native language knowledge, is largely implicit, being represented without awareness of its complex structures and incidentally acquired through interaction with a large number of samples. Two experiments explore implicit learning of hierarchical harmonic structures of different complexity employing an artificial grammar learning paradigm. The experiments consisted of an incidental learning phase using a distraction task, and a testing phase employing the process dissociation procedure paradigm (Jacoby, 1991). Participants performed significantly above chance and recognised adjacent and long-distance dependencies in both experiments. Confidence ratings and inclusion/exclusion response patterns suggest that both implicit structure knowledge and explicit judgment knowledge are in operation. Participants recognised stimuli with deep structures that appeared in the learning phase better than new structures for the more complex grammar, whereas there was no such difference for the simpler grammar. They performed significantly better for the less complex grammar which indicates that grammatical complexity affects learnability and recognition performance. The results conform to other experimental findings that musicians and nonmusicians are able to perceive long-distance dependencies and embedded structures in tonal harmony.},

	abstract = {Tonality and Transformation is a groundbreaking study in the analysis of tonal music. Focusing on the listener's experience, author Steven Rings employs transformational music theory to illuminate diverse aspects of tonal hearing - from the infusion of sounding pitches with familiar tonal qualities to sensations of directedness and attraction. In the process, Rings introduces a host of new analytical techniques for the study of the tonal repertory, demonstrating their application in vivid interpretive set pieces on music from Bach to Mahler. The analyses place the book's novel techniques in dialogue with existing tonal methodologies, such as Schenkerian theory, avoiding partisan debate in favor of a methodologically careful, pluralistic approach. Rings also engages neo-Riemannian theory-a popular branch of transformational thought focused on chromatic harmony-reanimating its basic operations with tonal dynamism and bringing them into closer rapprochement with traditional tonal concepts. Written in a direct and engaging style, with lively prose and plain-English descriptions of all technical ideas, Tonality and Transformation balances theoretical substance with accessibility: it will appeal to both specialists and non-specialists. It is a particularly attractive volume for those new to transformational theory: in addition to its original theoretical content, the book offers an excellent introduction to transformational thought, including a chapter that outlines the theory's conceptual foundations and formal apparatus, as well as a glossary of common technical terms. A contribution to our understanding of tonal phenomenology and a landmark in the analytical application of transformational techniques, Tonality and Transformation is an indispensible work of music theory [Publisher description]},

We review three factors that make music an important topic for cognitive scientific research. First, music is a universal human trait fulfilling crucial roles in everyday life. Second, music has an important part to play in ontogenetic development and human evolution. Third, appreciating and producing music simultaneously engage many complex perceptual, cognitive, and emotional processes, rendering music an ideal object for studying the mind. We propose an integrated status for music cognition in the Cognitive Sciences and conclude by reviewing challenges and big questions in the field and the way in which these reflect recent developments.},

The aim of the present paper is to summarize empirical findings from music cognition research that are relevant to three prominent music theoretic domains: rhythm, melody, and tonality. Attention is paid to how cognitive processes like category formation, stimulus grouping, and expectation can account for the music theoretic key concepts in these domains, such as beat, meter, voice, consonance. We give an overview of computational models that have been proposed in the literature for a variety of music processing tasks related to rhythm, melody, and tonality. Although the present state-of-the-art in computational modeling of music cognition definitely provides valuable resources for testing specific hypotheses and theories, we observe the need for models that integrate the various aspects of music perception and cognition into a single framework. Such models should be able to account for aspects that until now have only rarely been addressed in computational models of music cognition, like the active nature of perception and the development of cognitive capacities from infancy to adulthood. ?? 2008.},

Our approach is motivated by ecological validity: rather than taking musical stimuli and artificially simplifying them to make their study tractable, we have sought and found music which is appropriate to our study. We give a novel, detailed analysis of one piece, Glass’ Gradus, and show how the analysis corresponds with the information dynamics of the piece as heard. To show that this correspondence generalises, at least to music in a similar style by the same composer, we go on to analyse Glass’ Two Pages. We suggest that this research provides further evidence that information-dynamic modelling is a worthwhile approach to the study of music cognition and also has the potential, if automated, to be a powerful tool to increase objectivity in data-based music analysis.},

A hypothesis is presented that promises to unify the field and a theory is proposed of the origin of music based on the fundamental role of music in cognition. The split is considered of the vocalizations of proto-humans into two types: one less emotional and more concretely-semantic, evolving into language, and the other preserving emotional connections along with semantic ambiguity, evolving into music. The evolution of language toward the semantically powerful tool of today required emancipation from emotional encumbrances. Opposing, but no less powerful, mechanisms required a compensatory evolution of music toward more differentiated and refined emotionality. The need for refined music is grounded in fundamental mechanisms of the mind. This is why today’s human mind and cultures cannot exist without today’s music.

We discuss formal models developed to emulate, explain and predict phenomena involved in early auditory processing, pitch processing, grouping, source separation, and music structure computation. We cover generic computational architectures of attention, memory, and expectation that can be instantiated and tuned to deal with specific musical phenomena. Criteria for the evaluation of such models are presented and discussed.

	abstract = {Chords in musical harmony can be viewed as objects having shapes (major/minor/etc.) attached to base sets (pitch class sets). The base set and the shape set are usually given the structure of a group, more particularly a cyclic group. In a more general setting, any object could be defined by its position on a base set and by its internal shape or state. The goal of this paper is to determine the structure of simply transitive groups of transformations acting on such sets of objects with internal symmetries. In the main proposition, we state that, under simple axioms, these groups can be built as group extensions of the group associated with the base set by the group associated with the shape set, or the other way around. By doing so, interesting groups of transformations are obtained, including the traditional ones such as the dihedral groups. The knowledge of the group structure and product allows one to explicitly build group actions on the objects. In particular, we differentiate between left and right group actions and show how they are related to non-contextual and contextual transformations. Finally, we show how group extensions can be used to build transformational models of time-spans and rhythms.},

	abstract = {The prevalent approach to developing cognitive models of music perception and composition is to construct systems of symbolic rules and constraints on the basis of extensive music-theoretic and music-analytic knowledge. The the- sis proposed in this dissertation is that statistical models which acquire knowl- edge through the induction of regularities in corpora of existing music can, if examined with appropriate methodologies, provide significant insights into the cognitive processing involved in music perception and composition. This claim is examined in three stages. First, a number of statistical modelling techniques drawn from the fields of data compression, statistical language modelling and machine learning are subjected to empirical evaluation in the context of se- quential prediction of pitch structure in unseen melodies. This investigation results in a collection of modelling strategies which together yield significant performance improvements over existing methods. In the second stage, these statistical systems are used to examine observed patterns of expectation col- lected in previous psychological research on melody perception. In contrast to previous accounts of this data, the results demonstrate that these patterns of expectation can be accounted for in terms of the induction of statistical regu- larities acquired through exposure to music. In the final stage of the present research, the statistical systems developed in the first stage are used to examine the intrinsic computational demands of the task of composing a stylistically suc- cessful melody. The results suggest that the systems lack the degree of expres- sive power needed to consistently meet the demands of the task. In contrast to previous research, however, the methodological framework developed for the evaluation of computationalmodels of composition enables a detailed empirical examination and comparison of suchmodels which facilitates the identification and resolution of their weaknesses.},

	abstract = {The comparative study of music and language is drawing an increasing amount of research interest. Like language, music is a human universal involving perceptually discrete elements organized into hierarchically structured sequences. Music and language can thus serve as foils for each other in the study of brain mechanisms underlying complex sound processing, and comparative research can provide novel insights into the functional and neural architecture of both domains. This review focuses on syntax, using recent neuroimaging data and cognitive theory to propose a specific point of convergence between syntactic processing in language and music. This leads to testable predictions, including the prediction that that syntactic comprehension problems in Broca's aphasia are not selective to language but influence music perception as well.},

One approach to the empirical comparison of rhythm in language and music is to break rhythm down into subcomponents and compare each component across domains. This approach reveals empirical evidence that rhythmic grouping is an area of overlap between language and music, but no empirical support for the long-held notion that language has periodic structure comparable to that of music. Focusing on the statistical patterning of event duration, new evidence suggests that the linguistic rhythm of a culture leaves an imprint on its musical rhythm. The latter finding suggests that one effective strategy for comparing rhythm in language and music is to determine if differences in linguistic rhythm between cultures are reflected in differences in musical rhythm.},

A program is described which uses statistical machine learning tech- niques to learn this task from a suitable corpus of homo- phonic music. The task is decomposed into a series of more manageable sub-tasks; these are each modelled by Markov models, which can use contexts drawn from sym- bols describing past, current and future chords. The re- sults of a number of initial studies, for example compar- ing different types of model and the effect of corpus size, are given. There is also some discussion about harmonisa- tions that have been generated by the program by random sampling of the probability distributions in the models. Following this, a procedure for the systematic evaluation and “optimisation” of the sub-task models, involving the application of an information-theoretic measure, is pre- sented, along with some more results. An appraisal of the procedure’s shortcomings is made, and ideas for its im- provement are put forward. Finally, an indication of the future direction of the work (which is currently in its early stages) is given.},

David Lewin (1982, 1987) first described neo-Riemannian transformations, building on work by von Oettingen (1866) and Hugo Riemann (1880). In general, contextual transformations act on multisets of pitches or pitch classes and commute with transposition and inversion. Music theorists have studied contextual transformation groups extensively; in particular, Lewin (1987), Kochavi (1998), Cohn (1997), and Fiore and Satyendra (2005) used discrete group theory, while Clough (1998) and Gollin (1998) modeled contextual transformations with symmetries of discrete geometric spaces. We represent contextual transformations as linear transformations acting on sequences of pitches or pitch classes belonging to the continuous geometric voiceleading spaces developed by Callender, Quinn, and Tymoczko (2008). Subtleties arise that have not been explored in discrete models. Connections to tuning theory, neo-Riemannian theory, serial transformations, and musical examples from di Lasso, Brahms, and Schubert demonstrate the benefits of this approach.},

In the second part of the paper, I show how Clough and Douthett’s “Jfunction” began as a device for generating maximally even collections, only later evolving into a tool for studying the voice leadings between them. Particularly important here are Julian Hook’s “signature transformations,” which I generalize to a wider range of collections.

I will show that although these three measures are in principle quite distinct, they are in practice surprisingly interrelated. This poses the challenge of determining which model is appropriate to a given musictheoretical circumstance. Since the different models can produce comparable results, unwary theorists could potentially find themselves using one type of structure (such as a tuning lattice) to investigate properties more perspicuously represented by another (for instance, voice-leading relationships).},

As such, it provides a powerful tool for thinking about voice leading, one that can be used to answer familiar objections to the very notion of a voice leading between pitch-class sets. I begin by generalizing the traditional Western system of musical notation, defining paths in pitch-class space, and showing that key signatures are collections of such paths. I then show that it is always possible to find a minimal voice leading that has no voice crossings; however, it is not always possible to avoid voice crossings while maximizing common-tone retention. I describe a general method for identifying a minimal voice leading between arbitrary chords, and show that our familiar system of diatonic key signatures implements this method. I conclude by deriving a set of key signatures for the acoustic scale. These key signatures represent minimal voice leadings from the diatonic to the acoustic collection, and are interestingly related to the familiar diatonic key signatures.},

	abstract = {Taking David Lewin's work as a point of departure, this essay uses geometry to reexamine familiar music-theoretical assumptions about intervals and transformations. Section 1 introduces the problem of "transportability," noting that it is sometimes impossible to say whether two different directions - located at two different points in a geometrical space - are "the same" or not. Relevant examples include the surface of the earth and the geometrical spaces representing n-note chords. Section 2 argues the we should not require that every interval be defined at every point in a space, since some musical spaces have natural boundaries. It also notes that there are spaces, including the familiar pitch class circle, in which there are multiple paths between any two points. This leads to the suggestion that we might sometimes want to replace traditional pitch-class invervals with paths in pitch-class space, a more fine-grained alternative that specifies how one pitch class moves to another. Section 3 argues that group theory alone cannot represent the intuition that intervals have quantifiable sizes, proposing an extension to Lewin's formalism that accomplishes this goal. Finally, Section 4 considers the analytical implications of the preceding points, paying particular attention to questions about voice leading.},

	abstract = {The fundamental claim of this thesis is that music perception and cognition are embodied, situated activities. This means that they depend crucially on the physical constraints and enablings of our sensorimotor apparatus, and also on the ecological and sociocultural environment in which our music-listening and -producing capacities come into being. I argue that rhythm perception and production involve a complex, whole-body experience, and that much of the musical structure found in rhythm-based music incorporates an awareness of the embodied, situated role of the participant. The claim that music perception and cognition are embodied activities also means that they are actively constructed by the listener, rather than passively transferred from performer to listener. In particular, the discernment of entities such as pulse and meter from a given piece of music are not perceptual inevitabilities for any human being, but are strongly dependent on the persons culturally contingent listening strategies. In addition, I argue that certain kinds of rhythmic expression in what I call groove-based music are directly related not only to the role of the body in making music, but also to certain cultural aesthetics that privilege this role. Some common kinds of subtle microrhythmic variation are shown to display systematic structure, which often carries an encoded sonic trace of the music-making body. Throughout the text are included a number of illustrative musical examples, drawn from West African and African-American musical genres. The focus on this group of cultures stems from the salient role of embodied and situated dimensions in these particular musics, and from the authors expertise in their performance and analysis. However, these musics merely form a case study for the more general claim that these dimensions are operative in all music to varying degrees.},

The proposed theory is an expansion of Fred Lerdahl's tonal pitch space model; its purpose is a more accurate description of the situations involved in the analysis of diatonic modal music. The original methodology and set of algebraic calculating formulae is retained, but it is applied on modal instead of tonal space, on the basis that the latter is a subset of the former. In connection to Fred Lerdahl's theory, melodic motion, chord attraction and various cadence types are described within the modal context. Apart from the calculation of the pitch and the chordal and regional space algebraic representations, geometric representations of all three levels of the modal pitch space are also included. Finally, the stability conditions arising from the new model are used as criteria to build the time span reduction and prolongational reduction parts of the Generative Theory of Tonal Music (GTTM) analysis of modal music. Two short GTTM analyses of 20th century modal music are being presented to illustrate the new model's analytical use.},

In our experiment, participants judged the key of melodies generated randomly from pitch-class distributions characteristic of tonal music. Slightly more than half of listeners' judgments matched the generating keys, on both the untimed and the timed conditions. While this performance is much better than chance, it also indicates that the distributional view is far from a complete explanation of human key identification. No difference was found between participants with regard to absolute pitch ability, either in the speed or accuracy of their key judgments. Several key-finding models were tested on the melodies to see which yielded the best match to participants' responses.},

Each feature requires different computational processes: meter involves representing repeating cycles of strong and weak beats; pattern involves representing intervals at each local time point which vary in length across segments and are linked hierarchically; and tempo requires representing frequency rates of underlying pulse structures. We explored whether distinct rhythmic elements engage different neural mechanisms by recording brain activity of adult musicians and non-musicians with positron emission tomography (PET) as they made covert same-different discriminations of (a) pairs of rhythmic, monotonic tone sequences representing changes in pattern, tempo, and meter, and (b) pairs of isochronous melodies. Common to pattern, meter, and tempo tasks were focal activities in right, or bilateral, areas of frontal, cingulate, parietal, prefrontal, temporal, and cerebellar cortices. Meter processing alone activated areas in right prefrontal and inferior frontal cortex associated with more cognitive and abstract representations. Pattern processing alone recruited right cortical areas involved in different kinds of auditory processing. Tempo processing alone engaged mechanisms subserving somatosensory and premotor information (e.g., posterior insula, postcentral gyrus). Melody produced activity different from the rhythm conditions (e.g., right anterior insula and various cerebellar areas). These exploratory findings suggest the outlines of some distinct neural components underlying the components of rhythmic structure.},

Bayesian modeling also relates in interesting ways to a number of other musical issues, including musical tension, ambiguity, expectation, and the quantitative description of styles and stylistic differences.},

	title = {Tonal centers and expectancy: {Facilitation} or inhibition of chords at the top of the harmonic hierarchy?},
	abstract = {Harmonic priming studies have shown that a musical context with its tonal center influences target chord processing. In comparison with targets following baseline contexts, which do not establish a specific tonal center, processing is facilitated for a strongly related target functioning as the tonic, but inhibited for unrelated (out-of-key) and less related (subdominant) targets. This study investigated cost and benefit patterns for the processing of the 3 most important chords of the harmonic hierarchy. Response time patterns reflected the chords' ranking: Processing was fastest for the tonic, followed by the dominant, and then the subdominant. The comparison with baseline contexts replicated the benefit of processing for tonic targets (Experiments 1 and 3) and the cost of processing for subdominant targets (Experiment 3), while dominant targets were situated at baseline level (Experiments 1 to 3). Findings indicate that listeners implicitly understand fine differences in tonal stabilities and confirm the special status of the tonic being the most expected and solely facilitated chord at the end of a tonal context. Findings are discussed with references to sensory and cognitive approaches of music perception.},

	abstract = {This study examines the Krumhansl-Schmuckler key-finding model, in which the distribution of pitch classes in a piece is compared with an ideal distribution or "key profile" for each key. Several changes are proposed. First, the formula used for the matching process is somewhat simplified. Second, alternative values are proposed for the key profiles themselves. Third, rather than summing the durations of all events of each pitch class, the revised model divides the piece into short segments and labels each pitch class as present or absent in each segment. Fourth, a mechanism for modulation is proposed; a penalty is imposed for changing key from one segment to the next. An implementation of this model was subjected to two tests. First, the model was tested on the fugue subjects from Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier; the model's performance on this corpus is compared with the performances of other models. Second, the model was tested on a corpus of excerpts from the Kostka and Payne harmony textbook (as analyzed by Kostka). Several problems with the modified algorithm are discussed, concerning the rate of modulation, the role of harmony in key finding, and the role of pitch "spellings." The model is also compared with Huron and Parncutt's exponential decay model. The tests presented here suggest that the key-profile model, with the modifications proposed, can provide a highly successful approach to key finding.},

(This does not necessarily mean our perception of the shift is gradual, a separate and complex issue which I also address.) Drawing an analogy with transitions between keys, I call such shifts "hypermetrical transitions."

	abstract = {There is an important distinction to be drawn in the way different kinds of motivic relationships are perceived. Some relationships are detected quickly and automatically; other kinds are detected (if at all) only slowly and deliberately. There is a phenomenological difference here as well. These differences are nicely accounted for by Jerry Fodor's theory of modularity. It is argued that certain relationships are perceived in a "modular" fashion, and others are not. It is hypothesized that the relationships perceived in a modular way are those between segments that are (a) related by tonal transposition and (b) parallel relative to the metrical structure. This view accounts for the differences between perception of different kinds of relationships and also sheds light on metrical structure in general, the "rehearing" problem, and the issue of "mandatoriness" in musical perception.},

	abstract = {This study conducted a perceptual analysis of an excerpt from Beethoven's Waldstein piano sonata in four experiments. The experiments were followed by an application of Lerdahl's (2001) Tonal Pitch Space theory, or TPS, to perceptual judgments of musical tension over the course of the excerpt. In the experiments, data were obtained for each of 15 time points corresponding to the 15 successive sonorities in the excerpt. Listeners in the first three experiments were piano students who learned and performed the excerpt before participating in the experimental tasks. In Experiment 1, judgments of phrase structure permitted examination of the perceptual segmentation of the excerpt. In Experiment 2, probe-tone ratings (Krumhansl and Kessler, 1982) were used to derive both a measure of perceived distance traveled in key space as well as a measure of temporal orientation — the degree to which listening at each time point was retrospective or prospective. In Experiment 3, a tension contour over the 15 time points was derived from listeners' continuous responding to perceived tension throughout the excerpt. In Experiment 4, judgments of consonance/dissonance for each sonority, isolated from context and presented in random order in a randomly selected transposition, were obtained from piano students unfamiliar with the excerpt. Strong correspondences were found between the perceptual measures and related music-theoretic predictors generated from TPS. The tension contour was regressed on TPS predictors. Both sensitivity to hierarchical structure and expectancies arising from voice leading, as well as the overall melodic contour, significantly contributed to the prediction of perceived tension.},

We suggest that a division into such groupings can be musically meaningful, and that it can be more flexible than similar approaches. We demonstrate our representation system at work in both analysis and composition, with output from computer programs. We conclude that it is possible and useful to represent music in a way independent of the particular style, tonal system, etc., of the music itself.},

To construct this theory, Euclid introduced in Book II the problem of dividing a segment into extreme and mean ratio (the “golden section”). It follows from Proclus’ hypothesis that Euclid’s Elements are the first attempt to create the “Mathematical Theory of the Universe Harmony”, based on Platonic solids and the “golden section”.},

Differentiation distinguishes elements from one another and was varied in terms of the distribution of pitch durations within tone sequences. Organization establishes relations between differentiated elements and was varied in terms of either conformity with or deviation from a hierarchical description of tonality. Multiple experiments demonstrated that the perception of tonality depended on a minimal degree of differentiation in the distribution of the duration–but not frequency of occurrence –of pitches and only when pitch distributions were hierarchically organized. Moreover, the mere differentiation of the tonic from nontonic pitches was not sufficient to induce tonal percepts. These results are discussed in relation to tonal strength, musical expressiveness, and principles of auditory pattern processing.},

As globalization and Western music homogenize the world musical environment, it is imperative that diverse music and musical contexts are documented. Processes of music perception include grouping and segmentation, statistical learning and sensitivity to tonal and temporal hierarchies, and the development of tonal and temporal expectations. The interplay of auditory, visual, and motor modalities is discussed in light of synchronization and the way music moves via emotional response. Further research is needed to test deep-rooted psychological assumptions about music cognition with diverse materials and groups in dynamic contexts. Although empirical musicology provides keystones to unlock musical structures and organization, the psychological reality of those theorized structures for listeners and performers, and the broader implications for theories of music perception and cognition, awaits investigation.},

The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of temporal regularities on the implicit learning of an artificial pitch grammar. According to the dynamic attending theory (DAT) external regularities can entrain internal oscillators that guide attention over time, inducing temporal expectations that influence perception of future events. In the present study, the presentation of the artificial pitch grammar in the exposure phase was temporally either regular or irregular for one of two participant groups. Based on the DAT, it was hypothesized that the regular temporal presentation would favour implicit learning of tone structures in comparison to the irregular temporal presentation. Results demonstrated learning of the artificial grammar for the group with the regular exposure phase and partial learning for the group with the irregular exposure phase. These findings suggest that the regular presentation helps listeners to develop perceptual expectations about the temporal occurrence of future tones and thus facilitates the learning of the artificial pitch grammar.},

	abstract = {Formal language theory (FLT), part of the broader mathematical theory of computation, provides a systematic terminology and set of conventions for describing rules and the structures they generate, along with a rich body of discoveries and theorems concerning generative rule systems. Despite its name, FLT is not limited to human language, but is equally applicable to computer programs, music, visual patterns, animal vocalizations, RNA structure and even dance. In the last decade, this theory has been profitably used to frame hypotheses and to design brain imaging and animal-learning experiments, mostly using the 'artificial grammar-learning' paradigm. We offer a brief, non-technical introduction to FLT and then a more detailed analysis of empirical research based on this theory. We suggest that progress has been hampered by a pervasive conflation of distinct issues, including hierarchy, dependency, complexity and recursion. We offer clarifications of several relevant hypotheses and the experimental designs necessary to test them. We finally review the recent brain imaging literature, using formal languages, identifying areas of convergence and outstanding debates. We conclude that FLT has much to offer scientists who are interested in rigorous empirical investigations of human cognition from a neuroscientific and comparative perspective.},

With this grammar an automatic harmonic analysis of a sequence of symbolic chord labels is obtained in the form of a parse tree. The harmonic similarity is determined by finding and examining the largest labeled common embeddable subtree (LLCES) of two parse trees. For the calculation of the LLCES a new O(min(n,m)nm) time algorithm is presented, where n and m are the sizes of the trees. For the analysis of the LLCES we propose six distance measures that exploit several structural characteristics of the Combined LLCES. We demonstrate in a retrieval experiment that at least one of these new methods significantly outperforms a baseline string matching approach and thereby show that using additional musical knowledge from music cognitive and music theoretic models actually helps improving retrieval performance.},

	abstract = {Hegels Kunstbegriff wird aus dem Zentrum seines Philosophierens, d. h. aus der Logik entwickelt. Es zeigt sich erstens, daß Hegels Philosophie nicht thetisch ist, weil sie ein selbst standpunktloses Durchlaufen von Standpunkten ist, in dessen Verlauf das Denken jeweils in grundsätzlich verschiedener Weise zum Stehen kommt (Seins-, Wesens- Begriffslogik). Thematisch wird dies in Hegels Auffassung des Seins als eines Momentes am Übergang von Seins- zu Wesenslogik. Insofern das Sein ein Moment, d. h. Begriffsmoment des Wesens ist, ist es aus dem Wesen ableitbar, welches selbst folglich jenseits von Sein und Nicht-Sein gedacht werden muß. Die genaue Rekonstruktion dieses Zusammenhangs erlaubt es, die Frage nach dem Verhältnis Logik-Realphilosophie (Entschluß der Idee) in einer Weise zu lösen, die zugleich sichtbar macht, auf welche Frage eigentlich Hegel mit diesem und verwandten Theoriestücken (z. B.: ontologischer Beweis) antwortet. Es zeigt sich, daß er äuß erst radikal die Fragestellung selbst verlagert. Auf dieser Grundlage wird ferner der Freiheitsbegriff Hegels neu gefaß t, und zwar besonders im Hinblick auf seine verdeckte, aber allesentscheidende Funktion in der Dialektik der Idee des Guten. Freiheit ist noch etwas anderes als Autonomie, Sich-Wiederfinden im Anderen usw. Sie tritt in der Dialektik des Guten als Mittelbegriff einer logischen (d. h. notwendigen) Vermittlung auf und erweist so ihre Irreduktibilität. Dies gibt Anlaß zu einer Reinterpretation der Hegelschen Religionsphilosophie. Weder Apologie der bestehenden Religionen noch agnostische Kritik, zeigt sich "das Religiöse" vielmehr als der Grundzug einer gewissen Form der Menschlichkeit, in Bezug auf die die Frage erörtert wird, bis zu welchem Grade sie etwa datiert ("überholt") sei.},

In the subsequent test phase, participants either classified test tunes as obeying a rule (direct test) or rated their liking for the tunes (indirect test). Both the direct and indirect tests were sensitive to knowledge of chunks. However, only the indirect test was sensitive to knowledge of the inversion rule. Furthermore, the indirect test was overall significantly more sensitive than the direct test, thus suggesting that knowledge of the inversion rule was below an objective threshold of awareness.},

	abstract = {Perception of temporal patterns is fundamental to normal hearing, speech, motor control, and music. Certain types of pattern understanding are unique to humans, such as musical rhythm. Although human responses to musical rhythm are universal, there is much we do not understand about how rhythm is processed in the brain. Here, I consider findings from research into basic timing mechanisms and models through to the neuroscience of rhythm and meter. A network of neural areas, including motor regions, is regularly implicated in basic timing as well as processing of musical rhythm. However, fractionating the specific roles of individual areas in this network has remained a challenge. Distinctions in activity patterns appear between "automatic" and "cognitively controlled" timing processes, but the perception of musical rhythm requires features of both automatic and controlled processes. In addition, many experimental manipulations rely on participants directing their attention toward or away from certain stimulus features, and measuring corresponding differences in neural activity. Many temporal features, however, are implicitly processed whether attended to or not, making it difficult to create controlled baseline conditions for experimental comparisons. The variety of stimuli, paradigms, and definitions can further complicate comparisons across domains or methodologies. Despite these challenges, the high level of interest and multitude of methodological approaches from different cognitive domains (including music, language, and motor learning) have yielded new insights and hold promise for future progress.},

Three self-paced reading experiments were conducted involving the ambiguous word "that" in different syntactic environments in order to test these and other hypotheses.

	abstract = {This paper proposes a model that aims to illustrate how different human music cultures intersect and ‘‘dock in’’ to a set of music features that are univer- sally perceived, while also displaying culture-specific features that must be learned. The model emphasizes that over historic time the music in a given culture can ‘‘dock into’’ and ‘‘dock out of’’ cues that are universally perceived, shifting its potential for cross-cultural per- ception and interaction. While this model accounts for music ethnological evidence reviewed here, it also explains why universals of music perception cannot simply be determined by specifying the common denominator between the formal music features of all cultures. This report suggests that the Dock-in Model can be generalized to account for cross-cultural percep- tion more generally.},

	abstract = {It has long been debated which aspects of music perception are universal and which are developed only after exposure to a specific musical culture [1-5]. Here, we report a crosscultural study with participants from a native African population (Mafa) and Western participants, with both groups being naive to the music of the other respective culture. Experiment 1 investigated the ability to recognize three basic emotions (happy, sad, scared/fearful) expressed in Western music. Results show that the Mafas recognized happy, sad, and scared/fearful Western music excerpts above chance, indicating that the expression of these basic emotions in Western music can be recognized universally. Experiment 2 examined how a spectral manipulation of original, naturalistic music affects the perceived pleasantness of music in Western as well as in Mafa listeners. The spectral manipulation modified, among other factors, the sensory dissonance of the music. The data show that both groups preferred original Western music and also original Mafa music over their spectrally manipulated versions. It is likely that the sensory dissonance produced by the spectral manipulation was at least partly responsible for this effect, suggesting that consonance and permanent sensory dissonance universally influence the perceived pleasantness of music. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Given a string of triads representing a harmonic analysis of a piece, the task is to identify and label all substrings corresponding to these cycles with high accuracy. The solution method uses a noisy channel model implemented with weighted finitestate transducers. On a dataset of four works by Franz Schubert, our model predicted cycles in the same regions as cycles in the ground truth with a precision of 0.18 and a recall of 1.0. The recalled cycles had an average edit distance of 3.2 insertions or deletions from the ground truth cycles, which average 6.4 labeled triads in length. We suggest ways in which our model could be used to contribute to current work in music theory, and be generalized to other music pattern-finding applications.},

	abstract = {The ability to appreciate most Western music presupposes cognitive structures capable of abstracting an underlying harmonic structure from a complex string of musical events. In this paper we provide a description of the listener’s knowledge of hierarchies of harmonic stability. The organization of harmonic information may be summarized by Osix principles. Three of these principles-Key Membership, Intrakey Distance and Intrakey Asymmetry-govern harmonic organization independent of context. Three principles-Contextual Identity, Contextual Distance and Contextual Asymmetry-govern harmonic organization in the presence of a tonal context. Chords that are members of the same key are represented in a hierarchy of stability that is independent of context. chords from different keys are represented in a hierarchy of stability that is dependent upon the prevailing context. Two different experimental tasks were used to provide convergent evidence for these principles: 1) multidimensional scaling of chords in the absence of any context or in the presence of different tonal contexts, and 2) recognition memory for chords in random and tonal contexts. It is suggested that harmonically stable chords function as cognitive reference points for the system as a whole. The importance of representations of hierarachies of harmonic stability is discussed with respect to generative accounts of musical competence.},

	abstract = {It is often claimed that music and language share a process of hierarchical structure building, a mental “syntax”. Although several lines of research point to commonalities, and possibly a shared syntactic component, differences between “language syntax” and “music syntax” can also be found at several levels: conveyed meaning, and the atoms of combination, for example. To bring music and language closer to one another, some researchers have suggested a comparison between music and phonology (‘phonological syntax’), but here too, one quickly arrives at a situation of intriguing similarities and obvious differences. In this paper we suggest that a fruitful comparison between the two domains could benefit from taking the grammar of action into account. In particular, we suggest that what is called “syntax” can be investigated in terms of goal of action, action planning, motor control, and sensory-motor integration. At this level of comparison, we suggest that some of the differences between language and music could be explained in terms of different goals reflected in the hierarchical structures of action planning: the hierarchical structures of music arise to achieve goals with a strong relation to the affective-gestural system encoding tension-relaxation patterns as well as socio-intentional system, whereas hierarchical structures in language are embedded in a conceptual system that gives rise to compositional meaning. Similarities between music and language are most clear in the way several hierarchical plans for executing action are processed in time and sequentially integrated to achieve various goals.},

Without doubt the phenomenon of combination tones is connected with nonlinear phenomena in the human ear. Therefore, it is generally assumed that the explanation of this phenomenon is possible on the level of the ear. This paper proposes different approach, which assumes the existence of an additional mechanism beyond the ear. The aim of this mechanism is to diminish sensitivity of the auditory process to nonlinear distortions by appropriate decoding of sound information. The general rule of construction and the mathematical model of such a mechanism is proposed, which allows for the explanation of many problems associated with combination tones. As a consequence an unexpected result is obtained with regard to a combination tone 2f1-f2 that it can originate already from the nonlinear distortion of the second order. This mathematical model is formulated in terms of finite groups.},

An interval cycle is the minimum number of additive iterations of an interval that are required for the original pitch classes to be restated—a formal property that we hypothesize leads to perceptual grouping referred to as interval-cycle proximity. The interval cycles that best explain the extent to which any chord’s interval-cycle profilecorrelates with the tonal hierarchies are found to be those belonging to dominant harmonies, particularly the dominant seventh. The results of the analyses and the intervalcycle proximityhypothesis are discussed with respect to Browne’s (1981) rare-interval hypothesisand Brower’s (2000) musical pattern mapping schema},

Psychophysical testing suggests that individuals with amusia have above average thresholds for detection of pitch change and pitch direction discrimination; however, a low-level auditory perceptual problem cannot completely explain the disorder, since discrimination of melodies is also impaired when the constituent intervals are suprathreshold for perception. the aim of the present study was to test pitch memory as a function of (a) time and (b) tonal interference, in order to determine whether pitch traces are inherently weaker in amusic individuals. Memory for the pitch of single tones was compared using two versions of a paradigm developed by deutsch (1970a). in both tasks, participants compared the pitch of a standard (s) versus a comparison (c) tone. in the time task, the sand ctones were presented, separated in time by 0, 1, 5, 10, and 15 s (blocked presentation). in the interference task, the sand ctones were presented with a fixed time interval (5 s) but with a variable number of irrelevant tones in between: 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 tones (blocked presentation). in the time task, control performance remained high for all time intervals, but amusics showed a performance decrement over time. in the interference task, controls and amusics showed a similar performance decrement with increasing number of irrelevant tones. overall, the results suggest that the pitch representations of amusic individuals are less stable and more prone to decay than those of matched non-amusic individuals.},

The model predicts the level of tonal attraction between temporally adjacent chords. The functional ambiguity of nineteenth-century chromatic harmony can be problematic: chromatic chords, unlike diatonic harmony, often have ill-defined roots, and thus their proper functions are difficult to establish. An important feature of the model, however,is that the key or tonal context of the music does not need tobe specified. The model is based on the ideaof ‘interval cycle proximity’(\{ICP)\}, a grouping mechanism hypothesized to contribute to the perception of tonal \{attraction.This\} paper illustrates the model with an analysis of the opening of Wagner’s \{‘Tristan\} und Isolde’, and showsthat the model can predict the opening sequence of \{‘Tristan’\} in terms of tonal attraction without the chords needing to be functionally specified.},

For a true understanding, the power of mathematics should be applied to the process of musical behaviour, not merely to its product. That process lies in the embodied human mind. Keywords:},

An interval cycle is the minimum number of (additive) iterations of an interval that are required for octave-related pitches to be re-stated, a property conjectured to be responsible for tonal attraction. It is hypothesised that the actuation of ICP in cognition, possibly in the latter part of the sixteenth century, led to a hierarchy of tonal attraction which favoured certain pitches over others, ostensibly the tonics of the modern major and minor system. An ICP model is described that calculates the level of tonal attraction between adjacent musical elements. The predictions of the model are shown to be consistent with music-theoretic accounts of common practice period tonality, including Piston's Table of Usual Root Progressions. The development of tonality is illustrated with the historical quotations of commentators from the sixteenth to the eighteenth centuries, and can be characterised as follows. At the beginning of the seventeenth century multiple 'finals' were possible, each associated with a different interval configuration (mode). By the end of the seventeenth century, however, only two interval configurations were in regular use: those pertaining to the modern majorminor key system. The implications of this development are discussed with respect interval cycles and their hypothesised effect within music.},

The first is the fuzziness of the key notion "tonality" itself, which leads to divergent conceptualizations of tonality induction, such as "key finding," "tonal induction," "tonal center perception," and "tonal feeling." I argue that the fuzziness is largely due to the lack of welldefined historical or otherwise categorical boundaries of "Western tonal music." The second impediment arises from various dualities in music, notably tone versus note representations, tonal versus intervallic representations, horizontal ("leading voice") cues for tonality induction versus vertical ones ("fundamentals"), and tonal versus temporal tonality induction cues. (Dis) advantages of various interpretations of tonality induction and of solutions of the dualities in question are considered. A few recommendations for reconciliation between currently divergent theoretical approaches to tonality induction are suggested.},

To know whether a non-significant result counts against a theory, or if it just indicates data insensitivity, researchers must use one of: power, intervals (such as confidence or credibility intervals), or else an indicator of the relative evidence for one theory over another, such as a Bayes factor. I argue Bayes factors allow theory to be linked to data in a way that overcomes the weaknesses of the other approaches. Specifically, Bayes factors use the data themselves to determine their sensitivity in distinguishing theories (unlike power), and they make use of those aspects of a theory’s predictions that are often easiest to specify (unlike power and intervals, which require specifying the minimal interesting value in order to address theory). Bayes factors provide a coherent approach to determining whether non-significant results support a null hypothesis over a theory, or whether the data are just insensitive. They allow accepting and rejecting the null hypothesis to be put on an equal footing. Concrete examples are provided to indicate the range of application of a simple online Bayes calculator, which reveal both the strengths and weaknesses of Bayes factors.},

	abstract = {Carl Friedrich Weitzmann's treatise on the augmented triad (1853) anticipates modern chromatic theory in several concrete respects. Weitzmann's exploration of semitonal voice-leading between augmented and consonant triads leads him to suggest a configuration of Klang-space that is complementary to my hexatonic systems (1996). Douthett's Cube Dance (1998) unites the two complementary perspectives. Further parallels are noted between Weitzmann's conception of augmented triad space (as reflected in Liszt's Faust Symphony) and Boretz's conception of diminished-seventh space (as reflected in Wagner's Tristan Prelude). The final part of the article explores Weitzmann's position vis-à-vis the evolution of chromatic space.},

	abstract = {The `bootstrapping' to which the title of this paper refers was used metaphorically in 1984 by Diana Deutsch to describe simultaneous generation of more than one mental map, in which each perceptual schema somehow helps to co-generate the other. While Deutsch's attention was focused on `bootstraping' of tonal and event hierarchies, the term has been used more broadly to refer to other possible instances of co-generating mental representations; one example is seen in the proposition that metrical cues help to guide judgments of tonality, while tonal and harmonic cues simultaneously serve as metrical cues. This paper will make some connections among some of the theoretical and experimental literature contributed in the past decade; these connections seem to indicate that aural key recognition may be an elaborate example of this sort of co-generation. The most reasonable reaction to this literature may be to admit that although it is possible to arrange tonal pitch information within a fairly coherent hierarchy in the abstract, the perceptual activity of getting one's tonal bearings within that hierarchy may involve sampling idiosyncratically from several different levels within it. But it would be helpful first to review the literature leading up to these hunches.},

	abstract = {In recent years Hugo Riemann's ideas have thoroughly captured the music-theoretical imagination, both in the United States and abroad. Neo-Riemannian theory has proven particularly adept at explaining features of chromatic music where other theoretical approaches have failed, and thereby established itself as the leading theoretical approach of our time. The Oxford Handbook of Neo-Riemannian Music Theories brings together an international group of leading proponents of Riemannian and neo-Riemannian theory for a thoroughgoing exploration of the music-analytical, systematic, and historical aspects of this important new field. The volume elucidates key aspects of the field, draws connections between Riemann's original ideas and current thought, and suggests new applications and avenues for further study. A number of essays suggest connections to other fields of inquiry, such as cognitive and mathematical music theory, as well as applications in the field of metric or melodic analysis. The selection of essays is complemented by several of Hugo Riemann's key original texts, many of which appear in English translation for the first time, and is rounded off by a glossary of key concepts for easy reference.},

It is a generalization of the well-known Oettingen–Riemann torus for triads of neo-Riemannian theories. Two pentachords are near if they differ by a particular set of contextual inversions and the whole contextual group generated by these inversions produces a tiling (tessellation) by pentagons on the surfaces. A description of the surfaces as coverings of a particular tiling is given in the 12-tone enharmonic scale case. Section 6 contains the main theorem, which gives the construction of a tiled surface by pentagons so that all transforms of a given pentachord fit together. This surface is a covering of a genus 13 surface, which is in turn a 2-to-1 cover of the genus 4 Bring surface.},

The set of such voice-leadings for the major and minor triads includes the Tonnetz, which leads to an understanding of how to use related geometries for all trichords, higher arities of chord, voice-leading solutions, and chord progressions. The present work demonstrates the use of such spaces for algorithmic composition. A Lindenmayer system takes an axiom and symbol replacement rules, and recursively rewrites the axiom by applying the rules. A turtle that represents a chord, which moves within either a voice-leading space or a chord progression space, then interprets the symbols in the ﬁnal production of the Lindenmayer system as commands for writing a score. This shows how score generators can work in mathematical spaces which have intrinsic musical structure.},

	title = {On group-theoretical methods applied to music: some compositional and implementational aspects},
	abstract = {This paper focuses on the group-theoretical approach to music theory and composition. In particular we concentrate on a family of groups which seem to be very interesting for a mathemusical research: the non-Hajós groups. This family of groups will be considered in relationships with Anatol Vieru's »Theory of modes« as it has been formalised and generalised to the rhythmic domain by the Roumanian mathematician Dan T udor V uza. They represent the general framework where one can formalize the construction of a special family of tiling canons called the »Regular Unending Complementary Canons of Maximal Category« (RCMC-canons). This model has been implemented in Ircam's visual programming language OpenMusic. Canons which are constructible through the V uza's algorithm are called Vuza Canons. The implementation of V uza's model in OpenMusic enables to give the complete list of such canons and offers to composers an useful tool to manipulate complex global musical structures. The implementation shows many interesting mathematical properties of the compositional process which could be taken as a point of departure for a computational-oriented musicological discussion.},

inverse “similarity”) that produce three different musico-geometrical spaces:
the first, based on voice leading, yields a collection of continuous quotient
spaces or orbifolds; the second, based on acoustics, gives rise to the Tonnetz
and related “tuning lattices”; while the third, based on the total interval content
of a group of notes, generates a six-dimensional “quality space” first described
by Ian Quinn. I will show that although these three measures are in principle
quite distinct, they are in practice surprisingly interrelated. This poses the
challenge of determining which model is appropriate to a given musictheoretical circumstance. Since the different models can produce comparable
results, unwary theorists could potentially find themselves using one type of
structure (such as a tuning lattice) to investigate properties more perspicuously
represented by another (for instance, voice-leading relationships).},

	abstract = {Tonality and Transformation is a groundbreaking study in the analysis of tonal music. Focusing on the listener's experience, author Steven Rings employs transformational music theory to illuminate diverse aspects of tonal hearing - from the infusion of sounding pitches with familiar tonal qualities to sensations of directedness and attraction. In the process, Rings introduces a host of new analytical techniques for the study of the tonal repertory, demonstrating their application in vivid interpretive set pieces on music from Bach to Mahler. The analyses place the book's novel techniques in dialogue with existing tonal methodologies, such as Schenkerian theory, avoiding partisan debate in favor of a methodologically careful, pluralistic approach. Rings also engages neo-Riemannian theory-a popular branch of transformational thought focused on chromatic harmony-reanimating its basic operations with tonal dynamism and bringing them into closer rapprochement with traditional tonal concepts. Written in a direct and engaging style, with lively prose and plain-English descriptions of all technical ideas, Tonality and Transformation balances theoretical substance with accessibility: it will appeal to both specialists and non-specialists. It is a particularly attractive volume for those new to transformational theory: in addition to its original theoretical content, the book offers an excellent introduction to transformational thought, including a chapter that outlines the theory's conceptual foundations and formal apparatus, as well as a glossary of common technical terms. A contribution to our understanding of tonal phenomenology and a landmark in the analytical application of transformational techniques, Tonality and Transformation is an indispensible work of music theory [Publisher description]},

	abstract = {Congenital  amusia  (amusia,  hereafter)  is  a  developmental  disorder  that  impacts  negatively  on
the perception of music. Psychophysical testing suggests that individuals with amusia have above
average  thresholds  for  detection  of  pitch  change  and  pitch  direction  discrimination;  however,
a low-level auditory perceptual problem cannot completely explain the disorder, since discrimination of melodies is also impaired when the constituent intervals are suprathreshold for perception.
the aim of the present study was to test pitch memory as a function of (a) time and (b) tonal interference, in order to determine whether pitch traces are inherently weaker in amusic individuals.
Memory for the pitch of single tones was compared using two versions of a paradigm developed
by deutsch (1970a). in both tasks, participants compared the pitch of a standard (s) versus a comparison (c) tone. in the time task, the sand ctones were presented, separated in time by 0, 1, 5, 10,
and 15 s (blocked presentation). in the interference task, the sand ctones were presented with
a fixed time interval (5 s) but with a variable number of irrelevant tones in between: 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8
tones (blocked presentation). in the time task, control performance remained high for all time intervals, but amusics showed a performance decrement over time. in the interference task, controls
and amusics showed a similar performance decrement with increasing number of irrelevant tones.
overall, the results suggest that the pitch representations of amusic individuals are less stable and
more prone to decay than those of matched non-amusic individuals.},

	abstract = {This study conducted a perceptual analysis of an excerpt from Beethoven's Waldstein piano sonata in four experiments. The experiments were followed by an application of Lerdahl's (2001) Tonal Pitch Space theory, or TPS, to perceptual judgments of musical tension over the course of the excerpt. In the experiments, data were obtained for each of 15 time points corresponding to the 15 successive sonorities in the excerpt. Listeners in the first three experiments were piano students who learned and performed the excerpt before participating in the experimental tasks. In Experiment 1, judgments of phrase structure permitted examination of the perceptual segmentation of the excerpt. In Experiment 2, probe-tone ratings (Krumhansl and Kessler, 1982) were used to derive both a measure of perceived distance traveled in key space as well as a measure of temporal orientation — the degree to which listening at each time point was retrospective or prospective. In Experiment 3, a tension contour over the 15 time points was derived from listeners' continuous responding to perceived tension throughout the excerpt. In Experiment 4, judgments of consonance/dissonance for each sonority, isolated from context and presented in random order in a randomly selected transposition, were obtained from piano students unfamiliar with the excerpt. Strong correspondences were found between the perceptual measures and related music-theoretic predictors generated from TPS. The tension contour was regressed on TPS predictors. Both sensitivity to hierarchical structure and expectancies arising from voice leading, as well as the overall melodic contour, significantly contributed to the prediction of perceived tension.},

	abstract = {As we experience a temporal flux of events our expectations of future events change. Such expectations seem
to be central to our perception of affect in music, but we have little understanding of how expectations
change as recent information is integrated. When music establishes a pitch centre (tonality), we rapidly learn
to anticipate its continuation. What happens when anticipations are challenged by new events? Here we
show that providing a melodic challenge to an established tonality leads to progressive changes in the impact
of the features of the stimulus on listeners’ expectations. The results demonstrate that retrospective analysis
of recent events can establish new patterns of expectation that converge towards probabilistic
interpretations of the temporal stream. These studies point to wider applications of understanding the
impact of information flow on future prediction and its behavioural utility.},

In neomechanism one is thinking of man as an information processing system or as an (abstract) automaton or an equivalent formal system. It is pointed out that one should better speak of cognitive science and not of cognitive sciences as, for example, in France. Cognitive science can serve as a fruitful paradigm in musical research only if the neomechanistic framework is accepted. Musicology working in this mechanistic framework ‐ also called cognitive science and music ‐ is called cognitive musicology and futhermore devided, like linguistics, in three main research areas: theoretical musicology, psychomusicology and neuromusicology.},

Subjects listened to an unfamiliar piece in a familiar musical idiom, and their sensitivities to aspects of the just-heard piece were used to elucidate the nature of their representations of the piece in recent memory. The study also sought to assess the capacities of subjects to use any declarative knowledge of aspects of tonal structure that they possessed in organizing musical material. Three experiments made use of different procedures to address these issues, using either a single short tonal piece—Schubert's Valse sentimentale, D. 779, op. 50, no. 6—or a variant of this. The first two experiments used nonmusician subjects and examined (1) the cues abstracted in listening to the piece and (2) subjects' ability to identify the temporal location of segments of the piece after listening. The third experiment explored the constructional abilities of musician and nonmusician subjects, requiring them to create a coherent piece by ordering the segments that made up the original piece. The results of these experiments indicated that although the abilities of musicians differed from those of nonmusicians, both groups of subjects exhibited a weaker sensitivity to features of musical structure than to cues abstracted from the musical surface.},

However, the requirement to recall six numbers spoken at equal loudness during the identical retention interval produced only a minimum decrement in the same pitch-recognition task. Further, the requirement to remember the tone produced no decrement in recall of the numbers. It is concluded that immediate memory for pitch is subject to a large interference effect which is highly specific in nature and which is not due to some limitation in general short-term memory capacity or to a distraction of attention.},

	abstract = {The increasingly intensive study of music by neuroscientists over the past two decades has established the neurosciences of music as a subdiscipline of cognitive neuroscience, responsible for investigating the neural basis for music perception, cognition, and emotion. In this endeavor, music perception and cognition have often been compared with language processing and understanding, while music-induced emotions are compared with emotions induced by visual stimuli. Here, we review research that is beginning to define a new field of study called neuroaesthetics of music. According to this fresh perspective, music is viewed primarily as an expressive art rather than as a cognitive domain. The goal of this emerging field is to understand the neural mechanisms and structures involved in the perceptual, affective and cognitive processes that generate the three principal aesthetic responses: emotions, judgments, and preference. Although much is known about the frontotemporal brain mechanisms underlying perceptual and cognitive musical processes, and about the limbic and paralimbic networks responsible for musical affect, there is a great deal of work to be done in understanding the neural chronometry and structures determining aesthetic responses to music. Research has only recently begun to delineate the modulatory effects of the listener, listening situation, and the properties of the music itself on a musical aesthetic experience. This article offers a review and synthesis of our current understanding of the perceptual, cognitive, and affective processes involved in an aesthetic musical experience and introduces a novel framework to coordinate future endeavors in an emerging field},

(This does not necessarily mean our perception of the shift is gradual, a separate and complex issue which I also address.) Drawing an analogy with transitions between keys, I call such shifts "hypermetrical transitions."

	abstract = {Theory predicts a close structural relation of formal languages with natural languages. Both share the aspect of an underlying grammar which either generates (hierarchically) structured expressions or allows us to decide whether a sentence is syntactically correct or not. The advantage of rule-based communication is commonly believed to be its efficiency and effectiveness. A particularly important class of formal languages are those underlying the mathematical syntax. Here we provide brain-imaging evidence that the syntactic processing of abstract mathematical formulae, written in a first order language, is, indeed efficient and effective as a rule-based generation and decision process. However, it is remarkable, that the neural network involved, consisting of intraparietal and prefrontal regions, only involves Broca's area in a surprisingly selective way. This seems to imply that despite structural analogies of common and current formal languages, at the neural level, mathematics and natural language are processed differently, in principal.},

	title = {Cassirer and structuralism of perception: an application of group theory to {Gestalt} psychology},
	abstract = {Ernst Cassirer's task was to set up an account of perception as objective judgement. We can trace Cassirer's view of perception through three different accounts each of which aimed to give an answer of how perceptual judgements can be possible. These three accounts started from (1900-1923) where he presented his view depending on Functional- Relational analysis of perceptual experience. The second account started from (1923-1933) where he presented his view of perception depending on symbolic analysis of perceptual experience, and finally the third account started from (1933-1945) where the analysis of perceptual phenomena has been made depending on his apprehension of Group Theory. The main target of Cassirer in the third account was to show that there is similarity between geometry and perception with respect to the ways both of these two disciplines build up their objects. Having the same logical base, Cassirer claimed that there is similarity between geometrical determination of the object and perceptual determination of the experienced object. For Cassirer, this similarity is what allows an application of "group theory" to perception. As a result of that claim, Cassirer shifted mathematical terms such as "invariance", "frame of reference" and "transformation" from the province of geometry and reused them in the field of perception for setting up what he called psychology of thought. This thesis discusses Cassirer's first two accounts and focuses on the third account by giving examples of how the mathematical concept of "group" can be used as an analogy to provide an intrinsic explanation of the nature of the objects and their characteristics one experiences during the perceptual situation. The explanations of the perceptual phenomena represented in the perceptual experience, as given by Cassirer, based on Gestalt psychology, reflected this understanding. The ample examples created by the Gestalt psychologists and used by Cassirer indicated how both understood the object of perceptual experience as constructed and not as a thing or hic et nunc. I will show that in these three accounts, there are non-physical elements, which defined here as structural elements, involved in the perceptual experience. By the virtue of these non-physical elements, perceptual judgements are possible. Cassirer and the Gestalt psychologists emphasized that these structural elements are presupposed in every perceptual experience and this understanding will lead to the claim that both Cassirer and the Gestaltists presupposed the constructive unity of mind based on a transcendental analysis of the nature of mind and its cognitive processes.},

Within this network, the prefrontal cortex represents a system that hosts three major components, namely, control, arithmetic-logic, and short-term memory. This prefrontal system operates on data fed to it by two other systems: a premotor-parietal top-down system that updates and transforms (external) data into an internal format, and a hippocampal bottom-up system that either detects novel information or serves as an access device to memory for previously acquired knowledge.},

The various modes differ in attainable precision, likely errors, and ease of use. A combination of such modes can be used to formulate an “ideal” model for interpreting scientific concepts both reliably and efficiently.

	title = {Towards a {Mathematical} {Model} of {Tonality}},
	abstract = {This dissertation addresses the question of how musical pitches generate a tonal center. Being able to characterize the relationships that generate a tonal center is crucial to the computer analysis and the generating of western tonal music. It also can inform issues of compositional styles, structural boundaries, and performance decisions. The proposed Spiral Array model offers a parsimonious description of the inter-relations among tonal elements, and suggests new ways to re-conceptualize and reorganize musical information. The Spiral Array generates representations for pitches, intervals, chords and keys within a single spatial framework, allowing comparisons among elements from different hierarchical levels. Structurally, this spatial representation is a helical realization of the harmonic network (tonnetz). The basic idea behind the Spiral Array is the representation of higher level tonal elements as composites of their lower level parts. The Spiral Array assigns greatest prominence to perfect fifth and major/minor third interval relations, placing elements related by these intervals in proximity to each other. As a result, distances between tonal entities as represented spatially in the model correspond to perceived distances among sounding entities. The parameter values that affect proximity relations are prescribed based on a few perceived relations among pitches, intervals, chords and keys. This process of interfacing between the model and actual perception creates the opportunity to research some basic, but till now unanswered questions about the relationships that generate tonality. A generative model, the Spiral Array also provides a framework on which to design viable and effcient algorithms for problems in music cognition. I demonstrate its versatility by applying the model to three different problems: I develop an algorithm to determine the key of musical passages that, on average, performs better than existing ones when applied to the 24 fugue subjects in Book 1 of Bach's \{WTC;\} I propose the first computationally viable method for determining modulations (the change of key); and, I design a basic algorithm for finding the roots of chords, comparing its results to those of algorithms by other researchers. All three algorithms were implemented in Matlab.},

The model predicts the level of tonal attraction between temporally adjacent chords. The functional ambiguity of nineteenth-century chromatic harmony can be problematic: chromatic chords, unlike diatonic harmony, often have ill-defined roots, and thus their proper functions are difficult to establish. An important feature of the model, however,is that the key or tonal context of the music does not need tobe specified. The model is based on the ideaof ‘interval cycle proximity’(\{ICP)\}, a grouping mechanism hypothesized to contribute to the perception of tonal \{attraction.This\} paper illustrates the model with an analysis of the opening of Wagner’s \{‘Tristan\} und Isolde’, and showsthat the model can predict the opening sequence of \{‘Tristan’\} in terms of tonal attraction without the chords needing to be functionally specified.},

	abstract = {The issue of the emergence of major-minor tonality is addressed by recourse to a novel pitch grouping process, referred to as interval cycle proximity (ICP). An interval cycle is the minimum number of (additive) iterations of an interval that are required for octave-related pitches to be re-stated, a property conjectured to be responsible for tonal attraction. It is hypothesised that the actuation of ICP in cognition, possibly in the latter part of the sixteenth century, led to a hierarchy of tonal attraction which favoured certain pitches over others, ostensibly the tonics of the modern major and minor system. An ICP model is described that calculates the level of tonal attraction between adjacent musical elements. The predictions of the model are shown to be consistent with music-theoretic accounts of common practice period tonality, including Piston's Table of Usual Root Progressions. The development of tonality is illustrated with the historical quotations of commentators from the sixteenth to the eighteenth centuries, and can be characterised as follows. At the beginning of the seventeenth century multiple 'finals' were possible, each associated with a different interval configuration (mode). By the end of the seventeenth century, however, only two interval configurations were in regular use: those pertaining to the modern majorminor key system. The implications of this development are discussed with respect interval cycles and their hypothesised effect within music.},

The rules constitute operations over variables and could not be appreciated as such by a system that can only chunk elements together. A series of studies investigated the extent to which people could implicitly (or explicitly) learn the structures of serialist music.We found that people who had no background in atonal music did not learn the structures, but highly selected participants with an interest in atonal music could implicitly learn to detect melodies instantiating the structures. The results have implications for both theorists of implicit learning and composers who may wish to know which structures they put into a piece of music can be appreciated.},

In a recent model of emotional responses to music (Molnar-Szakacs \& Overy, 2006), we proposed that music is perceived not only as an auditory signal, but also as intentional, hierarchically organized sequences of expressive motor acts behind the signal; and that the human mirror neuron system allows for corepresentation and sharing of a musical experience between agent and listener. Here, we expand upon this model of Shared Affective Motion Experience (SAME) and discuss its implications for music therapy and special education.We hypothesize that imitation, synchronization, and shared experience may be key elements of successful work in these areas.},

From mathematics, fractals need to be understood numerically; from music, a fractal composition is studied rhythmically, melodically and harmonically; from biology, the analysis focuses on the identification of the fractals in the nature. The main objective entails the reflection on the possibilities that interdisciplinarity offers in the training of teachers. An analysis on the predisposition of students to include integrated projects into their training may show information on the value they attach to the globalized educational.},

One approach to the empirical comparison of rhythm in language and music is to break rhythm down into subcomponents and compare each component across domains. This approach reveals empirical evidence that rhythmic grouping is an area of overlap between language and music, but no empirical support for the long-held notion that language has periodic structure comparable to that of music. Focusing on the statistical patterning of event duration, new evidence suggests that the linguistic rhythm of a culture leaves an imprint on its musical rhythm. The latter finding suggests that one effective strategy for comparing rhythm in language and music is to determine if differences in linguistic rhythm between cultures are reflected in differences in musical rhythm.},

However, empirical data supporting this idea have been lacking. This has been partly due to the difficulty of developing and applying comparable quantitative measures to melody and rhythm in speech and music. This study uses a recently-developed measure for the study of speech rhythm to compare rhythmic patterns in English and French language and classical music. We find that English and French musical themes are significantly different in this measure of rhythm, which also differentiates the rhythm of spoken English and French. Thus, there is an empirical basis for the claim that spoken prosody leaves an imprint on the music of a culture. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

	title = {Comparison between language and music},
	volume = {930},
	abstract = {Similarities and differences between language and music processing are examined from an evolutionary and a cognitive perspective. Language and music cannot be considered single entities; they need to be decomposed into different component operations or levels of processing. The central question concerns one of the most important claims of the generative grammar theory, that is, the specificity of language processing: do the computations performed to process language rely on specific linguistic processes or do they rely on general cognitive principles? Evidence from brain imaging results is reviewed, noting that this field is currently in need of metanalysis of the available results to precisely evaluate this claim. A series of experiments, mainly using the event-related brain potentials method, were conducted to compare different levels of processing in language and music. Overall, results favor language specificity when certain aspects of semantic processing in language are compared with certain aspects of melodic and harmonic processing in music. By contrast, results support the view that general cognitive principles are involved when aspects of syntactic processing in language are compared with aspects of harmonic processing in music. Moreover, analysis of the temporal structure led to similar effects in language and music. These tentative conclusions must be supported by other brain imaging results to shed further light on the spatiotemporal dynamics of the brain structure-function relationship.},

We compared processing of semantic meaning in language and music, investigating the semantic priming effect as indexed by behavioral measures and by the N400 component of the event-related brain potential (ERP) measured by electroencephalography (EEG). Human subjects were presented visually with target words after hearing either a spoken sentence or a musical excerpt. Target words that were semantically unrelated to prime sentences elicited a larger N400 than did target words that were preceded by semantically related sentences. In addition, target words that were preceded by semantically unrelated musical primes showed a similar N400 effect, as compared to target words preceded by related musical primes. The N400 priming effect did not differ between language and music with respect to time course, strength or neural generators. Our results indicate that both music and language can prime the meaning of a word, and that music can, as language, determine physiological indices of semantic processing.},

	abstract = {Hegels Kunstbegriff wird aus dem Zentrum seines Philosophierens, d. h. aus der Logik entwickelt. Es zeigt sich erstens, daß Hegels Philosophie nicht thetisch ist, weil sie ein selbst standpunktloses Durchlaufen von Standpunkten ist, in dessen Verlauf das Denken jeweils in grundsätzlich verschiedener Weise zum Stehen kommt (Seins-, Wesens- Begriffslogik). Thematisch wird dies in Hegels Auffassung des Seins als eines Momentes am Übergang von Seins- zu Wesenslogik. Insofern das Sein ein Moment, d. h. Begriffsmoment des Wesens ist, ist es aus dem Wesen ableitbar, welches selbst folglich jenseits von Sein und Nicht-Sein gedacht werden muß. Die genaue Rekonstruktion dieses Zusammenhangs erlaubt es, die Frage nach dem Verhältnis Logik-Realphilosophie (Entschluß der Idee) in einer Weise zu lösen, die zugleich sichtbar macht, auf welche Frage eigentlich Hegel mit diesem und verwandten Theoriestücken (z. B.: ontologischer Beweis) antwortet. Es zeigt sich, daß er äußerst radikal die Fragestellung selbst verlagert. Auf dieser Grundlage wird ferner der Freiheitsbegriff Hegels neu gefaßt, und zwar besonders im Hinblick auf seine verdeckte, aber allesentscheidende Funktion in der Dialektik der Idee des Guten. Freiheit ist noch etwas anderes als Autonomie, Sich-Wiederfinden im Anderen usw. Sie tritt in der Dialektik des Guten als Mittelbegriff einer logischen (d. h. notwendigen) Vermittlung auf und erweist so ihre Irreduktibilität. Dies gibt Anlaß zu einer Reinterpretation der Hegelschen Religionsphilosophie. Weder Apologie der bestehenden Religionen noch agnostische Kritik, zeigt sich "das Religiöse" vielmehr als der Grundzug einer gewissen Form der Menschlichkeit, in Bezug auf die die Frage erörtert wird, bis zu welchem Grade sie etwa datiert ("überholt") sei.},

This property characterizes positive standard words among their conjugates with respect to plain adjointness. The plain adjoint of the Ionian step-interval pattern aaba{\textbar}aab is the Ionian fifth-up/fourth-down folding pattern yx{\textbar}yxyxy. Three different kinds of mathematical objects are associated with one another: affine automorphisms of Z\_n, trajectories \{\vphantom{\}}0, ..., n] --{\textgreater} Z x Z traversing lifts of the graphs of affine automorphisms to fundamental domains of Z\_n x Z\_n within Z x Z, and well-formed words encoding the zigzag patterns of the trajectories in terms of binary words. Inversion of affine automorphisms is thereby associated with an extension of the duality of Christoffel words to their conjugates. Plain adjointness for positive standard words has a transformational expression in terms of the monoid-anti-automorphism of the special standard monoid.  Positive standard words are images of the word ab unter special standard morphisms f e (G, D). Plain adjointness corresponds to the reversal of the order of f. The factorization of f(ab) into the two factors f(a) and f(b) coincides with the authentic division.},

Specically, the musical trends at hand involved the use of unorthodox sets of pitches. These sets had the characteristic of retaining their triadic harmonies, but of sounding atonal. Neo-Riemannian theory not only allowed for the mathematical construction and description of these sets, some of which later were called the Hexatonic Systems, but also a means to explain how these systems were used. Involving the application of the P LR Operations, the analysis of the Hexatonic Systems is a primary component of neo-Riemannian theory.

	title = {Tonal {Hierarchies} in the {Music} of {North} {India}},
	volume = {113},
	abstract = {Cross-culturally, most music is tonal in the sense that one particular tone, called the tonic, provides a focus around which the other tones are organized. The specific orga- nizational structures around the tonic show considerable diversity. Previous studies of the perceptual response to Western tonal music have shown that listeners familiar with this musical tradition have internalized a great deal about its underlying organization. Krumhansl and Shepard (1979) developed a probe tone method for quantifying the perceived hierarchy of stability of tones. When applied to Western tonal contexts, the measured hierarchies were found to be consistent with music-theoretic accounts. In the present study, the probe tone method was used to quantify the perceived hierarchy of tones of North Indian music. Indian music is tonal and has many features in common with Western music. One of the most significant differences is that the primary means of expressing tonality in Indian music is through melody, whereas in Western music it is through harmony (the use of chords). Indian music is based on a standard set of melodic forms (called rags), which are themselves built on a large set of scales (thats). The tones within a rag are thought to be organized in a hierarchy of importance. Probe tone ratings were given by Indian and Western listeners in the context of 10 North Indian rags. These ratings confirmed the predicted hierarchical ordering. Both groups of listeners gave the highest ratings to the tonic and the fifth degree of the scale. These tones are considered by Indian music theorists to be structurally significant, as they are immovable tones around which the scale system is constructed, and they are sounded continuously in the drone. Relatively high ratings were also given to the vadi tone, which is designated for each rag and is given emphasis in the melody. The ratings of both groups of listeners generally reflected the pattern of tone durations in the musical contexts. This result suggests that the distribution of tones in music is a psychologically effective means of conveying the tonal hierarchy to listeners whether they are familiar with the musical tradition. Beyond this, only the Indian listeners were sensitive to the scales (thats) underlying the rags. For Indian listeners, multidimensional scaling of the correlations between the rating profiles recovered the theoretical representation of scales described by theorists of Indian music. Thus, the empirically measured tonal hierarchy induced by the rag contexts generates structure at the level of the underlying scales or thats, but its internalization apparently requires more extensive experience with music based on that scale system than that provided by the experimental context. There was little evidence that Western listeners assimilated the pitch materials to the major and minor diatonic system of Western music.},

	title = {Permutation groups and tesselations},
	abstract = {Analytical approaches to musical analysis have generally attempted to provide some kind of justification, and, in the last decades, to develop analytical elements based on tesselations of pitch class sets. When applied to atonal music, analytical approaches frequently fail to find internal coherence. Most of the time, tilings of chords are based on a torus representation, which follows the traditional principles of functional harmonic progression. A possible solution for determining a nice coherence of atonal chords progression is dependent on the topology of the tesselation involved. In the first section, we show that some tilings of chords could be related to the Klein bottle or to the projective plane. It is well known that tesselations are connected with groups. Consequently, possibilities of musical analyses can be suggested through a theoretical group approach. In the second section, we consider the neo-Riemannian theory, and suggest a number of revisions. We substitute the contextual transformations by three pointwise operations based on permutations, in order to link harmonic hierarchical or categorized structures with permutation groups. In the last section, we draw upon Olivier Messiaen’s works in order to show that some groups are more suitable than others for analytical approaches, but in any case, are related to some permutation groups.},

Given a string of triads representing a harmonic analysis of a piece, the task is to identify and label all substrings corresponding to these cycles with high accuracy. The solution method uses a noisy channel model implemented with weighted finitestate transducers. On a dataset of four works by Franz Schubert, our model predicted cycles in the same regions as cycles in the ground truth with a precision of 0.18 and a recall of 1.0. The recalled cycles had an average edit distance of 3.2 insertions or deletions from the ground truth cycles, which average 6.4 labeled triads in length. We suggest ways in which our model could be used to contribute to current work in music theory, and be generalized to other music pattern-finding applications.},

	title = {Linear {Contextual} {Transformations}},
	abstract = {This paper considers groups of musical contextual transformations,
the most famous of which is the group of “neo-Riemannian” transformations acting on the set of major and minor triads. David Lewin (1982,
1987) first described neo-Riemannian transformations, building on work
by von Oettingen (1866) and Hugo Riemann (1880). In general, contextual
transformations act on multisets of pitches or pitch classes and commute
with transposition and inversion. Music theorists have studied contextual
transformation groups extensively; in particular, Lewin (1987), Kochavi
(1998), Cohn (1997), and Fiore and Satyendra (2005) used discrete group
theory, while Clough (1998) and Gollin (1998) modeled contextual transformations with symmetries of discrete geometric spaces. We represent
contextual transformations as linear transformations acting on sequences
of pitches or pitch classes belonging to the continuous geometric voiceleading spaces developed by Callender, Quinn, and Tymoczko (2008).
Subtleties arise that have not been explored in discrete models. Connections to tuning theory, neo-Riemannian theory, serial transformations,
and musical examples from di Lasso, Brahms, and Schubert demonstrate
the benefits of this approach.},

	abstract = {Many properties of the mechanical word s = (b(n+1)gc−bngc)n=0,1,2,... play a strikingly illuminating role in music theory when g = log2 (3/2). This number represents the pitch height ratio between the musical intervals fifth and octave. The word s exemplifies the discrete rendering of the kernel of the linear pitch height form p : Z 2 → R with p(m, n) = gm + n on the Pythagorean tone lattice, which is the free Z-module of all linear combinations of these two intervals. Although this kernel as such should be musically redundant it turns out that the Christoffel-prefixes of its discrete rendering correspond to prominent musical tone systems ? as a side effect of the discretisation of a single pitch height level. More than that: Christoffel-duality and its extension to conjugates of Christoffel words provides deep insights into the constitution of musical modes. Sturmian morphisms provide a transformational metalanguage to this study. It is particularly challenging to music-theoretically interpret the role of special standard morphisms within the monoid St0 of all special Sturmian morphisms. For example, the authentically divided Ionian mode (aaba, aab) is the image of the pair (a, b) under the special standard morphism GGD, sending a to aaba and b to aab. The associated fifth up / fourth down - folding (yx, yxyxy) from F a to F a ] is the image of the “reversed” special standard morphism DGG, sending x to yx and y to yxyxy. The theory of Sturmian sequences and morphisms is a rich treasure of mathematical facts of ideas with cross-connections to combinatorics, number theory, braid groups, symbolic dynamics and other domains, and all of which may potentially constribute to the music-theoretical interpretation of the apparently “redundant” pitch height kernel and its translates.},

The appearance of pitch hierarchies is common to both approaches and thus provides a starting point for the discussion. There are two other theoretical aspects, which motivate the comparison between the two approaches: (a) the distinction between generic and specific intervals and (b) the duality between step interval patterns and fifth/fourth foldings in the theory of well-formed modes.},

provides a powerful tool for thinking about voice leading, one that can be used to answer
familiar objections to the very notion of a voice leading between pitch-class sets. I begin
by generalizing the traditional Western system of musical notation, defining paths in
pitch-class space, and showing that key signatures are collections of such paths. I then
show that it is always possible to find a minimal voice leading that has no voice
crossings; however, it is not always possible to avoid voice crossings while maximizing
common-tone retention. I describe a general method for identifying a minimal voice
leading between arbitrary chords, and show that our familiar system of diatonic key
signatures implements this method. I conclude by deriving a set of key signatures for the
acoustic scale. These key signatures represent minimal voice leadings from the diatonic
to the acoustic collection, and are interestingly related to the familiar diatonic key
signatures.},

In this paper we provide a description of the listener’s knowledge of hierarchies of harmonic stability. The organization of harmonic information may be summarized by Osix principles. Three of these principles-Key Membership, Intrakey Distance and Intrakey Asymmetry-govern harmonic organization independent of context. Three principles-Contextual Identity, Contextual Distance and Contextual Asymmetry-govern harmonic organization in the presence of a tonal context. Chords that are members of the same key are represented in a hierarchy of stability that is independent of context. chords from different keys are represented in a hierarchy of stability that is dependent upon the prevailing context. Two different experimental tasks were used to provide convergent evidence for these principles: 1) multidimensional scaling of chords in the absence of any context or in the presence of different tonal contexts, and 2) recognition memory for chords in random and tonal contexts. It is suggested that harmonically stable chords function as cognitive reference points for the system as a whole. The importance of representations of hierarachies of harmonic stability is discussed with respect to generative accounts of musical competence.},

The examples are chosen from the theoretical work and from the compositions of Olivier Messiaen (1908-1992), one of the most influential twentieth century composers and pedagogues. Messiaen consciously used mathematical concepts derived from symmetry and groups, in his teaching and in his compositions. Before dwelling on this, I will give a quick overview of the relation between mathematics and music. This will put the discussion on symmetry and group theory in music in a broader context and it will provide the reader of this handbook some background and some motivation for the subject. The relation between mathematics and music, during more than two millennia, was lively, widespread, and extremely enriching for both domains.},

	url = {http://archive.cnmat.berkeley.edu/People/Vijay/%20THESIS.html},
	abstract = {The fundamental claim of this thesis is that music perception and cognition are embodied, situated activities. This means that they depend crucially on the physical constraints and enablings of our sensorimotor apparatus, and also on the ecological and sociocultural environment in which our music-listening and -producing capacities come into being. I argue that rhythm perception and production involve a complex, whole-body experience, and that much of the musical structure found in rhythm-based music incorporates an awareness of the embodied, situated role of the participant. The claim that music perception and cognition are embodied activities also means that they are actively constructed by the listener, rather than passively transferred from performer to listener. In particular, the discernment of entities such as pulse and meter from a given piece of music are not perceptual inevitabilities for any human being, but are strongly dependent on the persons culturally contingent listening strategies. In addition, I argue that certain kinds of rhythmic expression in what I call groove-based music are directly related not only to the role of the body in making music, but also to certain cultural aesthetics that privilege this role. Some common kinds of subtle microrhythmic variation are shown to display systematic structure, which often carries an encoded sonic trace of the music-making body. Throughout the text are included a number of illustrative musical examples, drawn from West African and African-American musical genres. The focus on this group of cultures stems from the salient role of embodied and situated dimensions in these particular musics, and from the authors expertise in their performance and analysis. However, these musics merely form a case study for the more general claim that these dimensions are operative in all music to varying degrees.},

	abstract = {Archaeological evidence for musical activities pre-dates even the earliest-known cave art and it remains the case that no human culture has yet been encountered that does not practise some recognisably musical activity. Yet the human abilities to make and appreciate music have been described as "amongst the most mysterious with which [we are] endowed" (Charles Darwin, 1872) and music itself as "the supreme mystery of the science of man" (Claude Levi-Strauss, 1970). Like language, music has been the subject of keen investigation across a great diversity of fields, from neuroscience and psychology, to ethnography, to studies of its structures in its own dedicated field, musicology; unlike the evolution of human language abilities, it is only recently that the origins of musical capacities have begun to receive dedicated attention. It is increasingly clear that human musical abilities are fundamentally related to other important human abilities, yet much remains mysterious about this ubiquitous human phenomenon, not least its prehistoric origins. It is evident that no single field of investigation can address the wide range of issues relevant to answering the question of music's origins. This review brings together evidence from a wide range of anthropological and human sciences, including palaeoanthropology, archaeology, neuroscience, primatology and developmental psychology, in an attempt to elucidate the nature of the foundations of music, how they have evolved, and how they are related to capabilities underlying other important human behaviours. It is proposed that at their most fundamental level musical behaviours (including both vocalisation and dance) are forms of deliberate metrically-organised gesture, and constitute a specialised use of systems dedicated to the expression and comprehension of social and emotional information between individuals. The abilities underlying these behaviours are selectively advantageous themselves; in addition, various mechanisms by which the practice of musical activities themselves could be advantageous are outlined.},

	abstract = {Groove-based rhythm is a basic and much appreciated feature of Western popular music. It is commonly associated with dance, movement and pleasure and is characterized by the repetition of a basic rhythmic pattern. At various points in the musical course, drum breaks occur, representing a change compared to the repeated pattern of the groove. In the present experiment, we investigated the brain response to such drum breaks in a repetitive groove. Participants were scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while listening to a previously unheard naturalistic groove with drum breaks at uneven intervals. The rhythmic pattern and the timing of its different parts as performed were the only aspects that changed from the repetitive sections to the breaks. Differences in blood oxygen level-dependent activation were analyzed. In contrast to the repetitive parts, the drum breaks activated the left cerebellum, the right inferior frontal gyrus (RIFG), and the superior temporal gyri (STG) bilaterally. A tapping test using the same stimulus showed an increase in the standard deviation of inter-tap-intervals in the breaks versus the repetitive parts, indicating extra challenges for auditory-motor integration in the drum breaks. Both the RIFG and STG have been associated with structural irregularity and increase in musical-syntactical complexity in several earlier studies, whereas the left cerebellum is known to play a part in timing. Together these areas may be recruited in the breaks due to a prediction error process whereby the internal model is being updated. This concurs with previous research suggesting a network for predictive feed-forward control that comprises the cerebellum and the cortical areas that were activated in the breaks.},

Only recently, the necessary conditions of commutativity and multiplicativity have been formulated (Narens, 1996, Journal of Mathematical Psychology) and tested empirically, e.g., for the sensation of loudness. The present investigation evaluated these properties for the ratio production of pitch intervals. Musically trained (n = 10) and untrained (n = 11) participants adjusted intervals defined by two ascending pure-tone frequencies to given fractions (1/3, 1/2, 2/3), starting either from a 12 or 17-semitone standard pitch interval. The results show that the axioms of commutativity and multiplicativity held for most of the participants, irrespective of musical training. Furthermore, all participants produced larger frequency intervals in response to larger ratio numbers used in the instructions (monotonicity), but only musically trained participants were sensitive to the size of the standard interval (thus producing strictly increasing magnitudes). Overall, the results indicate that pitch intervals are ratio-scalable. However, restrictions must be made, especially for non-musical listeners, and when an octave is exceeded.},

Each feature requires different computational processes: meter involves representing repeating cycles of strong and weak beats; pattern involves representing intervals at each local time point which vary in length across segments and are linked hierarchically; and tempo requires representing frequency rates of underlying pulse structures. We explored whether distinct rhythmic elements engage different neural mechanisms by recording brain activity of adult musicians and non-musicians with positron emission tomography (PET) as they made covert same-different discriminations of (a) pairs of rhythmic, monotonic tone sequences representing changes in pattern, tempo, and meter, and (b) pairs of isochronous melodies. Common to pattern, meter, and tempo tasks were focal activities in right, or bilateral, areas of frontal, cingulate, parietal, prefrontal, temporal, and cerebellar cortices. Meter processing alone activated areas in right prefrontal and inferior frontal cortex associated with more cognitive and abstract representations. Pattern processing alone recruited right cortical areas involved in different kinds of auditory processing. Tempo processing alone engaged mechanisms subserving somatosensory and premotor information (e.g., posterior insula, postcentral gyrus). Melody produced activity different from the rhythm conditions (e.g., right anterior insula and various cerebellar areas). These exploratory findings suggest the outlines of some distinct neural components underlying the components of rhythmic structure.},

This sensitivity is considered in a cross-cultural context using two styles of music, Finnish spiritual folk hymns and North Sami yoiks. Previous research on melodic continuation judgments showed strong correlations with the statistics of the musical style, specifically, the tone distributions and two- and three-tone transitions. This article develops models using these three kinds of statistics to categorize short initial segments as coming from one style or the other. The model using tone distributions was found to make numerous categorization errors, which can be understood because the tone distributions for these styles are similar. However, categorization was better for the models that used two- and three-tone transitions. The major differences between the transitional probabilities in the styles were analyzed, and these differences were used to account for the cases that the models found difficult. These results point to listeners' sensitivity to higher order transition information and its utility for style identification.},

Of key interest is whether these forms of experience influence cognition through similar or distinct information processing mechanisms. Here, we recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) in three groups - bilinguals, musicians, and controls - who completed a visual go-nogo task that involved the withholding of key presses to rare targets. Participants in each group achieved similar accuracy rates and responses times but the analysis of cortical responses revealed significant differences in ERP waveforms. Success in withholding a prepotent response was associated with enhanced stimulus-locked N2 and P3 wave amplitude relative to go trials. For nogo trials, there were altered timing-specific ERP differences and graded amplitude differences observed in the neural responses across groups. Specifically, musicians showed an enhanced early P2 response accompanied by reduced N2 amplitude whereas bilinguals showed increased N2 amplitude coupled with an increased late positivity wave relative to controls. These findings demonstrate that bilingualism and music training have differential effects on the brain networks supporting executive control over behavior.},

	abstract = {From the late 1950s until 1975, cognition was understood mainly as disembodied symbol manipulation in cognitive psychology, linguistics, artificial intelligence, and the nascent field of Cognitive Science. The idea of embodied cognition entered the field of Cognitive Linguistics at its beginning in 1975. Since then, cognitive linguists, working with neuroscientists, computer scientists, and experimental psychologists, have been developing a neural theory of thought and language (NTTL). Central to NTTL are the following ideas: (a) we think with our brains, that is, thought is physical and is carried out by functional neural circuitry; (b) what makes thought meaningful are the ways those neural circuits are connected to the body and characterize embodied experience; (c) so-called abstract ideas are embodied in this way as well, as is language. Experimental results in embodied cognition are seen not only as confirming NTTL but also explained via NTTL, mostly via the neural theory of conceptual metaphor. Left behind more than three decades ago is the old idea that cognition uses the abstract manipulation of disembodied symbols that are meaningless in themselves but that somehow constitute internal "representations of external reality" without serious mediation by the body and brain. This article uniquely explains the connections between embodied cognition results since that time and results from cognitive linguistics, experimental psychology, computational modeling, and neuroscience.},

	abstract = {In the past, notions of embodiment have been applied to robotics mainly in the realm of very simple robots, and supporting low-level mechanisms such as dynamics and navigation. In contrast, most human-like, interactive, and socially adept robotic systems turn away from embodiment and use amodal, symbolic, and modular approaches to cognition and interaction. At the same time, recent research in Embodied Cognition (EC) is spanning an increasing number of complex cognitive processes, including language, nonverbal communication, learning, and social behavior. This article suggests adopting a modern EC approach for autonomous robots interacting with humans. In particular, we present three core principles from EC that may be applicable to such robots: (a) modal perceptual representation, (b) action/perception and action/cognition integration, and (c) a simulation-based model of top-down perceptual biasing. We describe a computational framework based on these principles, and its implementation on two physical robots. This could provide a new paradigm for embodied human-robot interaction based on recent psychological and neurological findings.},

In what follows, I describe three different views that can be found in the current literature. I show how this debate centers around the question of whether the science of embodied cognition can retain the computer theory of mind. One view, which I will label body functionalism, takes the body to play the functional role of linking external resources for problem solving with internal biological machinery. Embodiment is thus understood in terms of the role the body plays in supporting the computational circuits that realize cognition. Body enactivism argues by contrast that no computational account of cognition can account for the role of commonsense knowledge in our everyday practical engagement with the world. I will attempt a reconciliation of these seemingly opposed views.},

	abstract = {Most current approaches to key-finding, either from symbolic data such as MIDI or from digital audio data, rely on pitch-class profiles. Our alternative approach is based on two ideas: first, that chord progressions, understood rather loosely as pairs of neighboring harmonic states demarcated by note onsets, are sufficient as windows for key-finding, at least in the chorale context; and second, that the encapsulated identity of a chord progression (modulo pitch-class transposition and revoicing) is sufficient – that is, that reduction of progressions to pitch-class distributions is not necessary for key-finding. The system has no access to explicit information about a chord progression other than its transpositional distribution in the training corpus, yet it is able to reach an almost stunning degree of subtlety in its harmonic analysis of chorales it’s never heard before. This suggests that reductionist approaches to tonality may be off the mark, or at least that pitch-class reductionism might not be necessary for a principled account of key.},

In the second, mathematical and computational approaches are found to differ significantly from those of music analysis in their purpose and effect. Other differences between the disciplines are examined in the use of metaphor in musical discourse, and misunderstandings over the role of abstraction and estimation.

While Deutsch's attention was focused on `bootstraping' of tonal and event hierarchies, the term has been used more broadly to refer to other possible instances of co-generating mental representations; one example is seen in the proposition that metrical cues help to guide judgments of tonality, while tonal and harmonic cues simultaneously serve as metrical cues. This paper will make some connections among some of the theoretical and experimental literature contributed in the past decade; these connections seem to indicate that aural key recognition may be an elaborate example of this sort of co-generation. The most reasonable reaction to this literature may be to admit that although it is possible to arrange tonal pitch information within a fairly coherent hierarchy in the abstract, the perceptual activity of getting one's tonal bearings within that hierarchy may involve sampling idiosyncratically from several different levels within it. But it would be helpful first to review the literature leading up to these hunches.},

Theories of embodied cognition provide a structure within which we can investigate the mechanisms underlying action's impact on thinking and reasoning.

Communication of emotions by music has received a great deal of attention during the last years and a large number of empirical studies have described the role of individual features (tempo, mode, articulation, timbre) in predicting the emotions suggested or invoked by the music. However, unlike the present work, relatively few studies have attempted to model continua of expressed emotions using a variety of musical features from audio-based representations in a correlation design. The construction of the computational model is divided into four separate phases, with a different focus for evaluation. These phases include the theoretical selection of relevant features, empirical assessment of feature validity, actual feature selection, and overall evaluation of the model. Existing research on music and emotions and extraction of musical features is reviewed in terms of these criteria. Examples drawn from recent studies of emotions within the context of film soundtracks are used to demonstrate each phase in the construction of the model. These models are able to explain the dominant part of the listeners' self-reports of the emotions expressed by music and the models show potential to generalize over different genres within Western music. Possible applications of the computational models of emotions are discussed.},

Studying music processing provides insight into how complex event sequences are learned, perceived, and represented by the brain. Given the temporal nature of sound, expectations, structural integration, and cognitive sequencing are central in music perception (i.e., which sounds are most likely to come next and at what moment should they occur?). This paper focuses on similarities in music and language cognition research, showing that music cognition research provides insight into the understanding of not only music processing but also language processing and the processing of other structured stimuli. The hypothesis of shared resources between music and language processing and of domain-general dynamic attention has motivated the development of research to test music as a means to stimulate sensory, cognitive, and motor processes.},

While previous studies have shown that these mental representations of music can be acquired rapidly and can influence preference, it is still unclear which aspects of music influence learning and preference formation. This article reports two experiments that use an artificial musical system to examine two questions: (1) which aspects of music matter most for learning, and (2) which aspects of music matter most for preference formation. Two aspects of music are tested: melody and harmony. In Experiment 1 we tested the learning and liking of a new musical system that is manipulated melodically so that only some of the possible conditional probabilities between successive notes are presented. In Experiment 2 we administered the same tests for learning and liking, but we used a musical system that is manipulated harmonically to eliminate the property of harmonic whole-integer ratios between pitches. Results show that disrupting melody (Experiment 1) disabled the learning of music without disrupting preference formation, whereas disrupting harmony (Experiment 2) does not affect learning and memory but disrupts preference formation. Results point to a possible dissociation between learning and preference in musical knowledge.},

In addition, we show that a nomological network of evidence (Schmitt \& Pilcher, 2004) can be built around the hypothesis that musicality is a cognitive adaptation. Within this network, different modes of evidence are gathered to support a specific evolutionary hypothesis. We show that the combination of psychological, medical, physiological, genetic, phylogenetic, hunter-gatherer, and cross-cultural evidence indicates that musicality is a cognitive adaptation.},

Participants acquired knowledge of grammatical melodic structures under incidental learning conditions in both experimental and untrained control conditions. Subsequent analysis indicates a large effect of unsupervised online learning in the experimental and control group throughout the course of the testing phase suggesting an effective ongoing learning process. Musicians did not outperform nonmusicians, indicating that musical expertise is not advantageous for the learning of a new, unfamiliar melodic system.

Opposing, but no less powerful, mechanisms required a compensatory evolution of music toward more differentiated and refined emotionality.

The 31 subjects’ experimen- tal task was to sing back a novel melody presented either as single note MIDI melody or as the vocal melodies in audio excerpts from real pop songs. Each subject was tested with 14 different melodies and could use up to 6 tri- als for each melody. The aim of the data analysis was to predict the similarity between the original melody and the sung recalls by the subjects. The similarity was measured with different algorithmic measures reflecting various structural aspects of melodies, e.g. melodic contour, inter- vals, rhythm, or melodic accents. Among the results of the data analysis are the descriptions of different learning curves for the different structural aspects over trials, and the general importance or persistence of the different musi- cal dimensions in memory. Although the study was carried out with 31 subjects due to the very time consuming proc- ess of transcription of the subjects’ sung recalls, the pre- liminary data analysis presented in ties paper is based solely on 10 subjects.},

A wealth of standard techniques has been developed to serve use cases like document retrieval, identiﬁcation of a ﬁnite vocabulary and synonyms, and the collocation of terms. Similarly, social networking among musicians in internet forums and the advent of automatic chord extraction have led to the establishment of chord databases, if on a smaller scale. Comparatively little research has been carried out on these growing corpora of chords. We suspect that one reason for this lack of research lies in the difﬁculty to decide if chords or other harmonic elements can be treated like lexemes in a text corpus. More simply, the question is: What is a word in terms of harmony? In this paper we propose a bottom-up approach. In order to ﬁnd harmonic units whose distributions resemble distributions of words we consider chord elements differing in (a) length of chord sequence (counted in chord symbols), and (b) chord alphabet. Using lengths from 1 to 4 and two different chord alphabets we obtain a parameter space of size 8. For each of the parameter settings we compute statistical summaries of the resulting frequency distribution of the harmonic unit. As results, we report the parameter settings for two different chord corpora (2500+ songs each) that generate a frequency model corresponding most closely to the Brown Corpus, a general text corpus of American English.},

A weighted combination of several similarity measures, representing two resp. three different sources of information, is found to explain user ratings best.

The method is based on the development of a novel probability model of the predominant key using the well known Pitch Class Profile (PCP or chroma) descriptor. This feature represents the importance of each note of the chromatic scale within the spectral content of the audio signal. Making use of PCP feature, a main novel contribution presented is the development of new profile models for the characterization of major and minor keys. Most of the key profile models found in the literature assign a single value to each pitch class for a particular key. This value represents the salience of this pitch class in a specific key. The new key profiles, that will be described in this paper, are based on the identification of specific probability density functions (PDFs), defined after the analysis of the presence of the pitch classes of the chromatic scale in the different keys.},

	title = {The construction and evaluation of statistical models of melodic structure in music perception and composition},
	abstract = {The prevalent approach to developing cognitive models of music perception and composition is to construct systems of symbolic rules and constraints on the basis of extensive music-theoretic and music-analytic knowledge. The the- sis proposed in this dissertation is that statistical models which acquire knowl- edge through the induction of regularities in corpora of existing music can, if examined with appropriate methodologies, provide significant insights into the cognitive processing involved in music perception and composition. This claim is examined in three stages. First, a number of statistical modelling techniques drawn from the fields of data compression, statistical language modelling and machine learning are subjected to empirical evaluation in the context of se- quential prediction of pitch structure in unseen melodies. This investigation results in a collection of modelling strategies which together yield significant performance improvements over existing methods. In the second stage, these statistical systems are used to examine observed patterns of expectation col- lected in previous psychological research on melody perception. In contrast to previous accounts of this data, the results demonstrate that these patterns of expectation can be accounted for in terms of the induction of statistical regu- larities acquired through exposure to music. In the final stage of the present research, the statistical systems developed in the first stage are used to examine the intrinsic computational demands of the task of composing a stylistically suc- cessful melody. The results suggest that the systems lack the degree of expres- sive power needed to consistently meet the demands of the task. In contrast to previous research, however, the methodological framework developed for the evaluation of computationalmodels of composition enables a detailed empirical examination and comparison of suchmodels which facilitates the identification and resolution of their weaknesses.},

	abstract = {The leitmotives in Richard Wagner’s Der Ring des Nibelungen serve a range of compositional and psychological functions, including the introduction of musical structure and mnemonic devices for the listener. Leitmotives in the Ring differ greatly in their construction, salient aspects (e.g. rhythmic, melodic, harmonic), and their usage in particular scenes and contexts. We aim to understand listeners’ real-time processing of leitmotives, and have gathered data from a memory test, probing participants’ memory for different leit- motives contained in a 10-minute excerpt from the opera Siegfried. An item response theory (IRT) approach was used to estimate item difficulty parameters as well as parameters characterizing participants’ individual recognition ability. We fit a series of IRT models to the data obtained from 68 participants, finding that a Rasch Model with an unconstrained but fixed discrimination parameter fit the data best accord- ing to the Bayesian Information Criterion. We further investigated the relationship between model parameters and factors such as: number of leitmotive occurrences in the excerpt; acoustical distance using chroma features (Mauch \& Dixon, 2010) and distance thresholding (Casey, Rhodes \& Slaney, 2008); extent of musical training; and objective and self-reported Wagner expertise, finding that performance in the objective Wagner test and chroma distance were statistically significant predictors, while number of occurrences, self-reported Wagner expertise and extent of musical training did not reach significance.},

	abstract = {We examined a variety of real-time responses evoked by a single piece of music, the organ Duetto BWV 805 by J S Bach. The primary data came from a concurrent probe-tone method in which the probe tone is sounded continuously with the music. Listeners judged how well the probe tone fit with the music at each point in time. The process was repeated for all probe tones of the chromatic scale. A self-organizing map (SOM) [Kohonen 1997 Self-organizing Maps (Berlin: Springer)] was used to represent the developing and changing sense of key reflected in these judgments. The SOM was trained on the probe-tone profiles for 24 major and minor keys (Krumhansl and Kessler 1982 Psychological Review 89 334{\textasciicircum}368). Projecting the concurrent probe-tone data onto the map showed changes both in the perceived keys and in their strengths. Two dynamic models of tonality induction were tested. Model 1 is based on pitch class distribu- tions. Model 2 is based on the tone-transition distributions; it tested the idea that the order of tones might provide additional information about tonality. Both models contained dynamic components for characterizing pitch strength and creating pitch memory representations. Both models produced results closely matching those of the concurrent probe-tone data. Finally real- time judgments of tension were measured. Tension correlated with distance away from the predominant key in the direction of keys built on the dominant and supertonic tones, and also correlated with dissonance.},

	abstract = {The acquisition of the hierarchy of tonal stabilities in music is investigated in children of elementary school age. Listeners judge how good short tone sequences sound as melodies. The ratings show a pattern of increasing differentiation of the pitches in an octave range. The youngest listeners distinguish between scale and nonscale tones; older listeners distinguish between the tonic triad tones and other scale components. A group of adult listeners show octave equivalence and temporal asymmetries, with a preference for sequences ending on the more stable tones within the hierarchy. Pitch height effects do not interact with the age of the listener. These results are discussed in terms of the primacy of physical variables, novice- expert differences, and general cognitive principles governing the acquisition and development ofinternal representations ofpitch relationships.},

	abstract = {This study investigated the strength of sensory and cognitive components involved in musical priming. In Experiment 1, the harmonic function of the target chord and the number of pitch classes shared by the prime sequence and the target chord were manipulated. In Experiment 2, the temporal course of sensory and cognitive priming was investigated. For both musician and nonmusician listeners, cognitive priming systematically overruled sensory priming even at fast and very fast tempi (300 ms and 150 ms per chord). Cognitive priming continued to challenge sensory priming processes at extremely fast tempo (75 ms per chord) but only for participants who began the experimental session with slower tempi. This outcome suggests that the cognitive component is a fast-acting component that competes with sensory priming. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

	abstract = {The effects of global harmonic contexts on expectancy formation were studied in a set of three experiments. Eight-chord sequences were presented to subjects. Expectations for the last chord were varied by manipulating the harmonic context created by the first six: in one context, the last chord was part of an authentic cadence (V–I), whereas in the other, it was a fourth harmonic degree following a full cadence (I–IV). Given this change in harmonic function, the last chord was assumed to be more expected in the former context, all the other local parameters being held constant. The effect of global context on expectancy formation was supported by the fact that subjects reported a lower degree of completion for sequences ending on an unexpected chord (Experiment 1), took longer to decide whether the last chord belonged to the sequence when the last chord was unexpected (Experiment 2), and took longer to decide whether the last chord was consonant or dissonant when it was unexpected (Experiment 3). These results are discussed with reference to current models of tonal cognition.},

The algorithm begins with a representation of a piece as pitches and durations; it generates a representation in which the piece is divided into segments labeled with roots. This is a project of psychological interest, because much evidence exists that harmonic analysis is performed by trained and untrained listeners during listening; however, the perspective of the current project is computational rather than psychological, simply examining what has to be done computationally to produce "correct" analyses for pieces. One of the major innovations of the project is that pitches and chords are both represented on a spatial representation known as the "line of fifths"; this is similar to the circle of fifths except that distinctions are made between different spellings of the same pitch class. The algorithm uses preference rules to evaluate different possible interpretations, selecting the interpretation that most satisfies the preference rules. The algorithm has been computationally implemented; examples of the program's output are given and discussed.},

The hypothesis that it is rare intervals, rather than physical properties of tones or static representations such as scales and triads, that play a significant role in a musician's perceptual process of key identification led to the first experimental study of context sufficiency in perception of tonality. Musicians extrapolated tonal centers upon aural presentation of subsets of a major diatonic set with an accuracy mean of 87\%. Univalent trichords gave 100\% clearer indication of tonal center than did multivalent trichords. The strength of the tonality percept was further explored by examining effects of temporal ordering and by evaluating relationships between formal training and test scores. In a second experiment, listeners judged appropriateness of tonal centers after hearing paired dyads consisting of the rarest intervals in the major set: the tritone and the two minor seconds. Listeners indicated strongest impressions of tonal center when the tritone was heard as a simultaneity. Test performance showed a stronger correlation with listeners' abilities to identify tonal centers in actual music than with listeners' status as musicians or nonmusicians. These results are interpreted as evidence of a widespread cognitive skill that interprets tonality as a system of tonal relations rather than just an abstracted collection of tones or a system governed by the psychophysical attributes of tones.},

Tying our past experiences to our present interactions with the environment, they enable us to recognize and understand new objects and events. Concepts are also relevant to understanding domains such as social situations, personality types, and even artistic styles. Yet like other phenomenologically simple cognitive processes such as walking or understanding speech, concept formation and use are maddeningly complex. Research since the 1970s and the decline of the "classical view" of concepts have greatly illuminated the psychology of concepts. But persistent theoretical disputes have sometimes obscured this progress. The Big Book of Concepts goes beyond those disputes to reveal the advances that have been made, focusing on the major empirical discoveries. By reviewing and evaluating research on diverse topics such as category learning, word meaning, conceptual development in infants and children, and the basic level of categorization, the book develops a much broader range of criteria than is usual for evaluating theories of concepts.},

	abstract = {Traditional approaches to combination tones based on Helmholtz theory encounter essential interpreting difficulties, which the most known example is the anomalous behaviour of the combination tone 2f1-f2. Without doubt the phenomenon of combination tones is connected with nonlinear phenomena in the human ear. Therefore, it is generally assumed that the explanation of this phenomenon is possible on the level of the ear. This paper proposes different approach, which assumes the existence of an additional mechanism beyond the ear. The aim of this mechanism is to diminish sensitivity of the auditory process to nonlinear distortions by appropriate decoding of sound information. The general rule of construction and the mathematical model of such a mechanism is proposed, which allows for the explanation of many problems associated with combination tones. As a consequence an unexpected result is obtained with regard to a combination tone 2f1-f2 that it can originate already from the nonlinear distortion of the second order. This mathematical model is formulated in terms of finite groups.},

The proposed theory is an expansion of Fred Lerdahl's tonal pitch space model; its purpose is a more accurate description of the situations involved in the analysis of diatonic modal music. The original methodology and set of algebraic calculating formulae is retained, but it is applied on modal instead of tonal space, on the basis that the latter is a subset of the former. In connection to Fred Lerdahl's theory, melodic motion, chord attraction and various cadence types are described within the modal context. Apart from the calculation of the pitch and the chordal and regional space algebraic representations, geometric representations of all three levels of the modal pitch space are also included. Finally, the stability conditions arising from the new model are used as criteria to build the time span reduction and prolongational reduction parts of the Generative Theory of Tonal Music (GTTM) analysis of modal music. Two short GTTM analyses of 20th century modal music are being presented to illustrate the new model's analytical use.},

	abstract = {Performing musicians invest thousands of hours becoming experts in a range of perceptual, attentional, and cognitive skills. The duration and intensity of musicians' training - far greater than that of most educational or rehabilitation programs - provides a useful model to test the extent to which skills acquired in one particular context (music) generalize to different domains. Here, we asked whether the instrument-specific and more instrument-general skills acquired during professional violinists' and pianists' training would generalize to superior performance on a wide range of analogous (largely non-musical) skills, when compared to closely matched non-musicians. Violinists and pianists outperformed non-musicians on fine-grained auditory psychophysical measures, but surprisingly did not differ from each other, despite the different demands of their instruments. Musician groups did differ on a tuning system perception task: violinists showed clearest biases towards the tuning system specific to their instrument, suggesting that long-term experience leads to selective perceptual benefits given a training-relevant context. However, we found only weak evidence of group differences in non-musical skills, with musicians differing marginally in one measure of sustained auditory attention, but not significantly on auditory scene analysis or multi-modal sequencing measures. Further, regression analyses showed that this sustained auditory attention metric predicted more variance in one auditory psychophysical measure than did musical expertise. Our findings suggest that specific musical expertise may yield distinct perceptual outcomes within contexts close to the area of training. Generalization of expertise to relevant cognitive domains may be less clear, particularly where the task context is non-musical.},

	volume = {1},
	url = {http://ojs.gold.ac.uk/index.php/sysmus14/article/view/243},
	abstract = {The subject of this paper is the cognition of triadic progressions in 19th century tonal music. Music psychological research concerning the cognition of harmonic progressions mainly relies on diatonic music in which triads are easily relatable to a key. Triadic distance is therefore measured in terms of root relationships to the tonal center, the tonic (Krumhansl \&amp; Kessler, 1982). This conception is not directly applicable to chromatic music where musical coherence is not only obtained by common a key. Transformational music theory puts strong emphasis on voice-leading parsimony as a measure of distance. The most efficient transformations between major and minor triads are P (parallel), R (relative) and L (leading-tone exchange), which is also in accordance with empirical findings of diatonic triadic relatedness (Krumhansl, 1998). Notably, P and R generate an octatonic scale containing eight major and minor triads which are claimed to be functionally equivalent. Transformational analyses result in sequential patterns of triadic progressions and an overarching key is not required. Based on an extended notion of function and acknowledging that there are compelling arguments for both hierarchical and sequential representations of the cognition of harmonic progressions a multi-level model is proposed that combines both approaches, adopting features of the generative model by Rohrmeier (2011). The two main components of the model are the concept of functional equivalence and the distinction between the hierarchic-syntactic cognition of functional progressions and the schematic cognition of functional values.},

	volume = {10},
	abstract = {This study aims its critical eye towards a conceptual narrative that current music scholars have inherited from their “New Musicological” forebears to describe the growth and development of knowledge in music scholarship. The narrative traces its origins to Thomas Kuhn, whose treatise The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (1962) proposes that knowledge will only advance through a series of conceptual crises during which a research paradigm that dominates within a particular field of study will be proven to be ineffective in the face of new research problems and will be discarded in a kind of conceptual “coup d’état.” Kuhn’s narrative, and the critical descriptions of music scholarship that have ensued, is premised on an either/or perception of the practice of research according to which scholars will be required to choose between an established research paradigm and a replacement methodology in times of conceptual crisis. His narrative does not admit the possibility that methodologies can coexist peacefully for long periods of time or that an approach that appears at first to be unsuited to a new research problem might adapt itself to that problem by merging with the new approach that is supposed to take its place in the Kuhnian narrative. This study will dispel this conceptual narrative with a statistical examination of the research interests represented in 171 sample articles drawn from a twenty-year period in the history of the field of music theory, which will show that the methodologies in that field appear to be more fluid and adaptable than the Kuhnian conceptual narrative would admit. The data presented here tracks new research trends in the field (such as the burgeoning interest in popular music, cognition, and critical theory) and demonstrates the degree to which established research trends like Schenkerian and set-theoretic analysis have been able to adjust themselves to newer trends. What the data proves is that existing research paradigms have been largely successful in their quest to fit into the new conceptual environments within which they find themselves. These findings suggest that a better metaphor for conceptual change might lie in the process of evolution, whereby an organism will be required to modify itself to fit into an ever-changing habitat and to respond to the demands made upon it by that environment. This study therefore concludes that the “revolutionary” description of conceptual change should be replace by an “evolutionary” description, and cites the work of the philosopher Stephen Toulmin to provide the basic plot of this new conceptual narrative.},

To construct this theory, Euclid introduced in Book II the problem of dividing a segment into extreme and mean ratio (the “golden section”).

We show how to infer parameters for our models from labelled ground-truth data, and examine the performance of our system on a test corpus (giving 75\% correct windowing decisions from optimal parameters). The performance characteristics of our system suggest that pitch class distributions alone do not capture all the information used in generating the ground-truth labels; we discuss the additional features likely to improve performance, and demonstrate that they can be seamlessly incorporated into our framework.},

The few experiments investigating temporal structure learning have concluded that temporal structures can be learned only when coupled with another structural dimension, such as musical pitch or spatial location. In these studies, the temporal structures were without metrical organization and were dependent upon participants' response times (Response-to-Stimulus Intervals). In our study, two experiments investigated temporal structure learning based on Inter-Onset-Intervals in the presence of an uncorrelated second dimension (ordinal structure) with metrically organized temporal structures. Our task was an adaptation of the classical Serial Reaction Time paradigm, using an implicit task in the auditory domain (syllable identification). Reaction times (RT) revealed that participants learned the temporal structures over the exposure blocks (decrease in RT) without a correlated ordinal dimension. The introduction of a test block with a novel temporal structure slowed RT and exemplified the typical implicit learning profile. Post-test results suggested that participants did not have explicit knowledge of the metrical temporal structures. These findings provide the first evidence of the learning of temporal structure with an uncorrelated ordinal structure, and set a foundation for further investigation of temporal cognition.},

	abstract = {Hierarchical structure with nested nonlocal dependencies is a key feature of human language and can be identified theoretically in most pieces of tonal music. However, previous studies have argued against the perception of such structures in music. Here, we show processing of nonlocal dependencies in music. We presented chorales by J. S. Bach and modified versions in which the hierarchical structure was rendered irregular whereas the local structure was kept intact. Brain electric responses differed between regular and irregular hierarchical structures, in both musicians and nonmusicians. This finding indicates that, when listening to music, humans apply cognitive processes that are capable of dealing with long-distance dependencies resulting from hierarchically organized syntactic structures. Our results reveal that a brain mechanism fundamental for syntactic processing is engaged during the perception of music, indicating that processing of hierarchical structure with nested nonlocal dependencies is not just a key component of human language, but a multidomain capacity of human cognition.},

It is argued that cadence effects formal closure only at middle-ground levels of structure; a cadential progressionis highly constrained in its harmonic content; cadential function precedes the moment of cadential arrival,whereas the music following this arrival may be postcadentialin function; cadential contentmust be distinguished from cadential function; cadence represents a formal end,not a rhythmic or textural stop; and cadential strength can be distinguished in its syntactical and rhetorical aspects. An analysis of selected musical passages demonstrates that an accurate identification of cadence has a major impact on the interpretation of musical form and phrase structure.},

The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of temporal regularities on the implicit learning of an artificial pitch grammar. According to the dynamic attending theory (DAT) external regularities can entrain internal oscillators that guide attention over time, inducing temporal expectations that influence perception of future events. In the present study, the presentation of the artificial pitch grammar in the exposure phase was temporally either regular or irregular for one of two participant groups. Based on the DAT, it was hypothesized that the regular temporal presentation would favour implicit learning of tone structures in comparison to the irregular temporal presentation. Results demonstrated learning of the artificial grammar for the group with the regular exposure phase and partial learning for the group with the irregular exposure phase. These findings suggest that the regular presentation helps listeners to develop perceptual expectations about the temporal occurrence of future tones and thus facilitates the learning of the artificial pitch grammar.},

With wind instruments, the overtone series of notes synchronize to nearly perfect harmonic relations due to nonlinear effects and turbulence at the driving mechanism although the overblown pitches of flutes or horns may differ considerably from such a simple harmonic relation. Organ pipes close to each other synchronize in pitch by interaction of the sound pressures. With violins, the sawtooth motion appears because of a synchronization of the stick/slip interaction with the string length. All these models are complex systems also showing bifurcations in terms of multiphonics, biphonation or subharmonics. On the subjects perception and music production side models of synchronization, like the free-energy principle modeling perception by minimizing surprise and adaptation to physical parameters of sound production, neural nets of timbre, tone, or rhythm perception or synergetic models of rhythm production are generally suited much better to model music perception than simplified linear models.},

However, most artificial grammar learning experiments have explored learning of simpler finite-state grammars, while studies exploring context-free grammars have not assessed awareness and implicitness. This paper explores the implicit learning of context-free grammars employing features of hierarchical organization, recursive embedding and long-distance dependencies. The grammars also featured the distinction between left- and right-branching structures, as well as between centre- and tail-embedding, both distinctions found in natural languages. People acquired unconscious knowledge of relations between grammatical classes even for dependencies over long distances, in ways that went beyond learning simpler relations (e.g. n-grams) between individual words. The structural distinctions drawn from linguistics also proved important as performance was greater for tail-embedding than centre-embedding structures. The results suggest the plausibility of implicit learning of complex context-free structures, which model some features of natural languages. They support the relevance of artificial grammar learning for probing mechanisms of language learning and challenge existing theories and computational models of implicit learning.},

Extending previous research (Rohrmeier, Rebuschat \& Cross, 2011), the identical finite-state grammar is employed having terminals (the alphabet) manipulated so that melodies generated systematically violated Narmour's principles. Results indicate that Narmour-inconsistent melodic materials impede implicit learning.

In a subsequent functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment, we identified blood oxygen level-dependent signal increases related to musical tension in the left lateral orbitofrontal cortex (pars orbitalis of the inferior frontal gyrus). In addition, a region of interest analysis in bilateral amygdala showed activation in the right superficial amygdala during periods of increasing tension (compared with decreasing tension).

In comparison with targets following baseline contexts, which do not establish a specific tonal center, processing is facilitated for a strongly related target functioning as the tonic, but inhibited for unrelated (out-of-key) and less related (subdominant) targets. This study investigated cost and benefit patterns for the processing of the 3 most important chords of the harmonic hierarchy. Response time patterns reflected the chords' ranking: Processing was fastest for the tonic, followed by the dominant, and then the subdominant. The comparison with baseline contexts replicated the benefit of processing for tonic targets (Experiments 1 and 3) and the cost of processing for subdominant targets (Experiment 3), while dominant targets were situated at baseline level (Experiments 1 to 3). Findings indicate that listeners implicitly understand fine differences in tonal stabilities and confirm the special status of the tonic being the most expected and solely facilitated chord at the end of a tonal context. Findings are discussed with references to sensory and cognitive approaches of music perception.},

	abstract = {The role of 2 psychological processes, differentiation and organization, were examined in the perception of musical tonality. Differentiation distinguishes elements from one another and was varied in terms of the distribution of pitch durations within tone sequences. Organization establishes relations between differentiated elements and was varied in terms of either conformity with or deviation from a hierarchical description of tonality. Multiple experiments demonstrated that the perception of tonality depended on a minimal degree of differentiation in the distribution of the duration--but not frequency of occurrence --of pitches and only when pitch distributions were hierarchically organized. Moreover, the mere differentiation of the tonic from nontonic pitches was not sufficient to induce tonal percepts. These results are discussed in relation to tonal strength, musical expressiveness, and principles of auditory pattern processing.},

Findings of above-chance performance of some untrained control groups in artificial grammar learning studies raise questions about the extent to which learning can occur in an untrained, unsupervised testing situation with both correct and incorrect structures. The plausibility of unsupervised online-learning effects was modelled with n-gram, chunking and simple recurrent network models. A novel evaluation framework was applied, which alternates forced binary grammaticality judgments and subsequent learning of the same stimulus. Our results indicate a strong online learning effect for n-gram and chunking models and a weaker effect for simple recurrent network models. Such findings suggest that online learning is a plausible effect of statistical chunk learning that is possible when ungrammatical sequences contain a large proportion of grammatical chunks. Such common effects of continuous statistical learning may underlie statistical and implicit learning paradigms and raise implications for study design and testing methodologies.},

Two experiments explore implicit learning of hierarchical harmonic structures of different complexity employing an artificial grammar learning paradigm. The experiments consisted of an incidental learning phase using a distraction task, and a testing phase employing the process dissociation procedure paradigm (Jacoby, 1991). Participants performed significantly above chance and recognised adjacent and long-distance dependencies in both experiments. Confidence ratings and inclusion/exclusion response patterns suggest that both implicit structure knowledge and explicit judgment knowledge are in operation. Participants recognised stimuli with deep structures that appeared in the learning phase better than new structures for the more complex grammar, whereas there was no such difference for the simpler grammar. They performed significantly better for the less complex grammar which indicates that grammatical complexity affects learnability and recognition performance. The results conform to other experimental findings that musicians and nonmusicians are able to perceive long-distance dependencies and embedded structures in tonal harmony.},

We review the scope and limits of theoretical accounts of musical prediction with respect to feature-based and temporal prediction. While the concept of prediction is unproblematic for basic single-stream features such as melody, it is not straight-forward for polyphonic structures or higher-order features such as formal predictions. Behavioural results based on explicit and implicit (priming) paradigms provide evidence of priming in various domains that may reflect predictive behaviour. Computational learning models, including symbolic (fragment-based), probabilistic/graphical, or connectionist approaches, provide well-specified predictive models of specific features and feature combinations. While models match some experimental results, full-fledged music prediction cannot yet be modelled. Neuroscientific results regarding the early right-anterior negativity (ERAN) and mismatch negativity (MMN) reflect expectancy violations on different levels of processing complexity, and provide some neural evidence for different predictive mechanisms. At present, the combinations of neural and computational modelling methodologies are at early stages and require further research.},

	abstract = {Music and speech are two of the most relevant and common sounds in the human environment. Perceiving and processing these two complex acoustical signals rely on a hierarchical functional network distributed throughout several brain regions within and beyond the auditory cortices. Given their similarities, the neural bases for processing these two complex sounds overlap to a certain degree, but particular brain regions may show selectivity for one or the other acoustic category, which we aimed to identify. We examined 53 subjects (28 of them professional musicians) by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), using a paradigm designed to identify regions showing increased activity in response to different types of musical stimuli, compared to different types of complex sounds, such as speech and non-linguistic vocalizations. We found a region in the anterior portion of the superior temporal gyrus (aSTG) (planum polare) that showed preferential activity in response to musical stimuli and was present in all our subjects, regardless of musical training, and invariant across different musical instruments (violin, piano or synthetic piano). Our data show that this cortical region is preferentially involved in processing musical, as compared to other complex sounds, suggesting a functional role as a second-order relay, possibly integrating acoustic characteristics intrinsic to music (e.g., melody extraction). Moreover, we assessed whether musical experience modulates the response of cortical regions involved in music processing and found evidence of functional differences between musicians and non-musicians during music listening. In particular, bilateral activation of the planum polare was more prevalent, but not exclusive, in musicians than non-musicians, and activation of the right posterior portion of the aSTG (planum temporale) differed between groups. Our results provide evidence of functional specialization for music processing in specific regions of the auditory cortex and show domain-specific functional differences possibly correlated with musicianship.},

A recent dynamic theory of musical tonality predicts that networks of auditory neurons resonate nonlinearly to musical stimuli. Nonlinear resonance leads to stability and attraction relationships among neural frequencies, and these neural dynamics give rise to the perception of relationships among tones that we collectively refer to as tonal cognition. Because this model describes the dynamics of neural populations, it makes specific predictions about human auditory neurophysiology. Here, we show how predictions about the auditory brainstem response (ABR) are derived from the model. To illustrate, we derive a prediction about population responses to musical intervals that has been observed in the human brainstem. Our modeled ABR shows qualitative agreement with important features of the human ABR. This provides a source of evidence that fundamental principles of auditory neurodynamics might underlie the perception of tonal relationships, and forces reevaluation of the role of learning and enculturation in tonal cognition.},

It is proposed that people combine: (a) context-dependent syntactic expectations (top-down statistical information) and (b) context-independent lexical-category frequencies of words (bottom-up statistical information) in order to resolve ambiguities in the lexical categories of words. Three self-paced reading experiments were conducted involving the ambiguous word "that" in different syntactic environments in order to test these and other hypotheses. The data support the top-down/bottom-up approach in which the relative frequencies of lexical entries for a word are tabulated independent of context. Data from other experiments from the literature are discussed with respect to the model proposed here. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	doi = {10.1525/mts.1985.7.1.02a00120},
	abstract = {All formal differences between language and music are a consequence of differences in their fundamental building blocks (arbitrary pairings of sound and meaning in the case of language; pitch-classes and pitch-class combinations in the case of music). In all other respects, language and music are identical. In particular, we argue, developing but also extending earlier proposals by Lerdahl and Jackendoff (1983), that music, like language, contains a syntactic component in which headed structures are built by iterated, recursive, binary Merge. This is the component that Lerdahl and Jackendoff called Prolongational Reduction, which represents hierarchical patterns of tension and relaxation in tonal harmony. We further argue that the distinct component that Lerdahl and Jackendoff called Time Span Reduction is a musical prosodic component (a point anticipated by Lerdahl and Jackendoff themselves) -- whose interface with the syntactic component is strikingly similar to the comparable interface between syntactic and prosodic structure in language. Though our discussion takes Lerdahl and Jackendoff's work as a starting point and touchstone throughout, our proposals also constitute a significant realignment of their model -- necessary in order to reveal similarities between musical and linguistic structure that were not evident in their presentation. This realignment also reflects a distinction in goals between our proposal and theirs. Their work took as its starting point the question "Given a piece of music in a particular musical idiom I, what laws govern the class of analyses that a listener assigns to it in I?" Our proposals arise from a related but distinct question, more typical of generative linguistic work: "What general laws define the class of possible pieces in I?" That is, what is the grammar of I? Our realignment of Lerdahl and Jackendoff's proposals in light of the Identity Thesis allows us to ask questions not taken up in their work. For example, does Internal Merge (i.e. syntactic movement) apply in the construction of musical syntactic structure, in addition to External Merge? We argue that the phenomenon of cadence is an instance of exactly this: head-movement from the penultimate constituent of a musical passage (the dominant) to the final tonic chord. Finally, we argue that the output of musical syntax feeds a Tonal-Harmonic Component whose formal relation to the music syntax strongly resembles the relation between linguistic syntax and the semantic system that interacts with it -- and is subject to a Principle of Full Interpretation with respect to that component.},

Patel challenges the widespread belief that music and language are processed independently. Since Plato's time, the relationship between music and language has attracted interest and debate from a wide range of thinkers. Recently, scientific research on this topic has been growing rapidly, as scholars from diverse disciplines, including linguistics, cognitive science, music cognition, and neuroscience are drawn to the music-language interface as one way to explore the extent to which different mental abilities are processed by separate brain mechanisms. Accordingly, the relevant data and theories have been spread across a range of disciplines. This volume provides the first synthesis, arguing that music and language share deep and critical connections, and that comparative research provides a powerful way to study the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying these uniquely human abilities.

We cover generic computational architectures of attention, memory, and expectation that can be instantiated and tuned to deal with specific musical phenomena.

	volume = {6},
	abstract = {Strengths and limitations of the tonal hierarchy theory, and of the probe-tone testing procedure used to substantiate that theory, are discussed. The tonal hierarchy theory is characterized as an important contribution in that it begins to describe hierarchical relationships of tones in the diatonic set. The tonal hierarchy theory is, however, criticized because it does not describe the mental process or processes by which the tonal center of a piece of tonal music is recognized, nor does it account for the dynamic perception of tonality as it unfolds during actual musical listening. The probe-tone testing procedure most often used to substantiate the tonal hierarchy theory is criticized for the ambiguity of its response task, so that test results could be an artifact of effects of short-term memory. An alternative perceptual theory is proposed to describe the time-dependent nature of pitch relationships in music. In this description, lis- teners are assumed to recognize the tonal center in tonal music on a best-evidence basis, and it is asserted that the clearest evidence is carried in the rarest-occurring intervals in the diatonic set. Evidence, gathered in a series of experiments, is cited to demonstrate that listeners both with and without extensive formal training in music form strong (and usually tacit) mental representations of unambiguous tonality when tones are arranged across time so as to form meaningful tonal referents.},

Three properties of musical schema are evaluated in a recognition memory experi- ment: (1)The schema engages a subset of the abstract knowledge system that is determined by the predominant key of the musical sequence, (2)the schema evaluates both interval relations and the functions of the sounded elements within the established tonal framework, and (3)the schema interacts continuously with the musical event in time to process pitch information in its temporal context. Listeners are required to identify the serial position ofa chord that is changed between two successive chord sequences that are otherwise identical. The experiment measures the magnitude and the temporal extent of the disruptive effect of including in the sequence an element outside the tonal framework. The results show temporally specific effects on memory for pitch relations consistent with the operation of a musical schema.

The task is decomposed into a series of more manageable sub-tasks; these are each modelled by Markov models, which can use contexts drawn from sym- bols describing past, current and future chords. The re- sults of a number of initial studies, for example compar- ing different types of model and the effect of corpus size, are given. There is also some discussion about harmonisa- tions that have been generated by the program by random sampling of the probability distributions in the models. Following this, a procedure for the systematic evaluation and “optimisation” of the sub-task models, involving the application of an information-theoretic measure, is pre- sented, along with some more results. An appraisal of the procedure’s shortcomings is made, and ideas for its im- provement are put forward.

Within the same set of consistently activated voxels, the topography of tonality selectivity rearranged itself across scanning sessions.

The aim of the present paper is to summarize empirical findings from music cognition research that are relevant to three prominent music theoretic domains: rhythm, melody, and tonality. Attention is paid to how cognitive processes like category formation, stimulus grouping, and expectation can account for the music theoretic key concepts in these domains, such as beat, meter, voice, consonance. We give an overview of computational models that have been proposed in the literature for a variety of music processing tasks related to rhythm, melody, and tonality. Although the present state-of-the-art in computational modeling of music cognition definitely provides valuable resources for testing specific hypotheses and theories, we observe the need for models that integrate the various aspects of music perception and cognition into a single framework. Such models should be able to account for aspects that until now have only rarely been addressed in computational models of music cognition, like the active nature of perception and the development of cognitive capacities from infancy to adulthood. ?? 2008.},

We give a novel, detailed analysis of one piece, Glass’ Gradus, and show how the analysis corresponds with the information dynamics of the piece as heard. To show that this correspondence generalises, at least to music in a similar style by the same composer, we go on to analyse Glass’ Two Pages. We suggest that this research provides further evidence that information-dynamic modelling is a worthwhile approach to the study of music cognition and also has the potential, if automated, to be a powerful tool to increase objectivity in data-based music analysis.},

In contrast, here similarity measures are compared on the basis of how much insight they provide about the structural inter-relationships that exist within families of rhythms, when phylogenetic trees and graphs are com- puted from the distance matrices determined by these sim- ilarity measures. Phylogenetic analyses yield insight into the evolution of rhythms and may uncover interesting an- cestral rhythms.},

In particular, several techniques useful for the teaching, analysis, generation and automated recognition of the rhythmic components of music are reviewed. A new measure of rhythm-evenness is described and shown to be better than previous measures for discriminating between rhythm timelines. It may also be more efficiently computed. Several open problems are discussed.},

Such line segments exist only when chords are nearly symmetrical under translation, reflection, or permutation.

Percentage of correct responses was analyzed in Experiment 1, and event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded in Experiments 2 and 3. Musicians performed better than nonmusicians in recognizing familiar musical phrases and classifying terminal notes. The differences found as a function of expertise were larger for unfamiliar than for familiar melodies. The ERPs to the end notes differed both in terms of amplitude and latency between musicians and nonmusicians, and as a function of participants' familiarity with the melodies and type of violation. Results show that expertise influences the decisional rather than the purely perceptual aspects of music processing and that ERPs can provide important insight into the study of music perception.},

The notions of «predicative thinking» versus «functional thinking» describe a cognitive pattern that tries to explain the preference or even special capability for either one of the two view points. Meanwhile, there are not only numerous qualitative experimental results that prove the usefulness of this theoretical construct, but also an EEG-study and several studies involving eye-movement analysis that emphasise quantitative evidence. As aspects of predicative thinking have been studied quite frequently in cognitive psychology, there is an accumulated need for studies of functional thinking. Primary school education shows that functional approaches have been neglected in spite of advocates of the operational principle. Anyhow, there are didactical materials like the Addition-, Multiplication-Landscape, the spiral staircase for calculating or the Dynamic Labyrinths that are very well suited to demand and promote functional thinking.},

	volume = {152},
	abstract = {The book A Generative Theory of Shape (Michael Leyton, Springer-Verlag, 2001) develops new foundations to geometry in which shape is equivalent to memory storage. With respect to this, the argument is given that art-works are maximal memory stores. The present paper reviews some of the basic principles concerning our claim that, in particular, musical works are maximal memory stores. The argument is that maximizing memory storage explains the structure of musical works. We ﬁrst review the basic geometric theory of the book: A generative theory of shape is developed that has two properties regarded as fundamental to intelligence – maximization of transfer and maximization of recoverability. Aesthetic structuration is taken to be equivalent to intelligence. Thus aesthetics is brought into the very foundations of the new theory of geometry. A mathematical theory of transfer and recoverability is developed, using symmetry-breaking wreath products. From this, it becomes possible to develop a theory of musical composition, as follows: Musical works are complex shapes. A theory of complex-shape generation is presented, in which any structure is described as unfolded from a maximally collapsed version of that structure, called an alignment kernel. This process is formalized by proposing a new class of groups called unfolding groups. The alignment kernel is a subgroup of that structure, consisting of symmetry ground-states which are themselves formalized by a new class of groups called iso-regular groups. In music, the iso-regular groups represent the anticipation hierarchies, for example the regular meters of the work. The process of musical composition is then described by an unfolding group, which "unfolds" the work, by successively breaking the iso-regular groups of the alignment kernel.},

Several changes are proposed. First, the formula used for the matching process is somewhat simplified. Second, alternative values are proposed for the key profiles themselves. Third, rather than summing the durations of all events of each pitch class, the revised model divides the piece into short segments and labels each pitch class as present or absent in each segment. Fourth, a mechanism for modulation is proposed; a penalty is imposed for changing key from one segment to the next. An implementation of this model was subjected to two tests. First, the model was tested on the fugue subjects from Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier; the model's performance on this corpus is compared with the performances of other models. Second, the model was tested on a corpus of excerpts from the Kostka and Payne harmony textbook (as analyzed by Kostka). Several problems with the modified algorithm are discussed, concerning the rate of modulation, the role of harmony in key finding, and the role of pitch "spellings." The model is also compared with Huron and Parncutt's exponential decay model. The tests presented here suggest that the key-profile model, with the modifications proposed, can provide a highly successful approach to key finding.},

With this grammar an automatic harmonic analysis of a sequence of symbolic chord labels is obtained in the form of a parse tree. The harmonic similarity is determined by finding and examining the largest labeled common embeddable subtree (LLCES) of two parse trees. For the calculation of the LLCES a new O(min(n,m)nm) time algorithm is presented, where n and m are the sizes of the trees. For the analysis of the LLCES we propose six distance measures that exploit several structural characteristics of the Combined LLCES. We demonstrate in a retrieval experiment that at least one of these new methods significantly outperforms a baseline string matching approach and thereby show that using additional musical knowledge from music cognitive and music theoretic models actually helps improving retrieval performance.},

	abstract = {Research indicates that people value music primarily because of the emotions it evokes. Yet, the notion of musical emotions remains controversial, and researchers have so far been unable to offer a satisfactory account of such emotions. We argue that the study of musical emotions has suffered from a neglect of underlying mechanisms. Specifically, researchers have studied musical emotions without regard to how they were evoked, or have assumed that the emotions must be based on the "default" mechanism for emotion induction, a cognitive appraisal. Here, we present a novel theoretical framework featuring six additional mechanisms through which music listening may induce emotions: (1) brain stem reflexes, (2) evaluative conditioning, (3) emotional contagion, (4) visual imagery, (5) episodic memory, and (6) musical expectancy. We propose that these mechanisms differ regarding such characteristics as their information focus, ontogenetic development, key brain regions, cultural impact, induction speed, degree of volitional influence, modularity, and dependence on musical structure. By synthesizing theory and findings from different domains, we are able to provide the first set of hypotheses that can help researchers to distinguish among the mechanisms. We show that failure to control for the underlying mechanism may lead to inconsistent or non-interpretable findings. Thus, we argue that the new framework may guide future research and help to resolve previous disagreements in the field. We conclude that music evokes emotions through mechanisms that are not unique to music, and that the study of musical emotions could benefit the emotion field as a whole by providing novel paradigms for emotion induction.},

Section 1 introduces the problem of "transportability," noting that it is sometimes impossible to say whether two different directions - located at two different points in a geometrical space - are "the same" or not. Relevant examples include the surface of the earth and the geometrical spaces representing n-note chords. Section 2 argues the we should not require that every interval be defined at every point in a space, since some musical spaces have natural boundaries. It also notes that there are spaces, including the familiar pitch class circle, in which there are multiple paths between any two points. This leads to the suggestion that we might sometimes want to replace traditional pitch-class invervals with paths in pitch-class space, a more fine-grained alternative that specifies how one pitch class moves to another. Section 3 argues that group theory alone cannot represent the intuition that intervals have quantifiable sizes, proposing an extension to Lewin's formalism that accomplishes this goal. Finally, Section 4 considers the analytical implications of the preceding points, paying particular attention to questions about voice leading.},

We test these measures on a set of puns and regular sentences and show that they correlate significantly with human judgments of funniness. Moreover, within a set of puns, the distinctiveness measure distinguishes exceptionally funny puns from mediocre ones. Our work is the first, to our knowledge, to integrate a computational model of general language understanding and humor theory to quantitatively predict humor at a fine-grained level. We present it as an example of a framework for applying models of language processing to understand higher-level linguistic and cognitive phenomena.},

	abstract = {This article discusses the extension of the notion of context from linguistics to the domain of music. In language, the statistical regularity known as Zipf’s law — which concerns the frequency of usage of different words — has been quantitatively related to the process of text generation. The connection is established by Simon’s model, on the basis of a few assumptions regarding the accompanying creation of context. This model captures the essential mechanism of repetition of perceptual elements, which underlies the construction of a structured, comprehensible message. Here, it is shown that the statistics of note usage in musical compositions are compatible with the predictions of Simon’s model. This result, which gives objective support to the conceptual likeness of context in language and music, is obtained through automatic analysis of the digital versions of several compositions. As a by-product, a quantitative measure of context definiteness is introduced, and used to compare tonal and atonal works.},

The use of recursive devices in formal grammars in the 1950s is summarised, and the work of Bar-Hillel and Chomsky from this period is analysed in some detail. Having established this historical context, the role of recursive definitions within the Minimalist Program is discussed at length, and the main focus falls upon comparatively recent claims concerning the centrality of recursion in the context of biolinguistics. Specifically, the hypothesis that recursion constitutes a species-specific property of the human language faculty that is particularly associated with natural language is (re)assessed, and it is suggested that, in the context of syntactic theory, the problematic term ‘recursion’ should be abandoned and replaced by less ambiguous terminology such as ‘inductive definition’.},

However, implicit learning and statistical learning research favor different interpretations, focusing on the formation of chunks and statistical computations, respectively.

To be successful, it must be constrained by knowledge of phonological structure. Then, turning to the bona fide theory of innateness--the Principles and Parameters framework--I argue that a full explanation of children's grammar development must abandon the domain-specific learning model of triggering, in favor of probabilistic learning mechanisms that might be domain-general but nevertheless operate in the domain-specific space of syntactic parameters.},

	abstract = {Behavioral scientists routinely publish broad claims about human psychology and behavior in the world's top journals based on samples drawn entirely from Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD) societies. Researchers - often implicitly - assume that either there is little variation across human populations, or that these "standard subjects" are as representative of the species as any other population. Are these assumptions justified? Here, our review of the comparative database from across the behavioral sciences suggests both that there is substantial variability in experimental results across populations and that WEIRD subjects are particularly unusual compared with the rest of the species - frequent outliers. The domains reviewed include visual perception, fairness, cooperation, spatial reasoning, categorization and inferential induction, moral reasoning, reasoning styles, self-concepts and related motivations, and the heritability of IQ. The findings suggest that members of WEIRD societies, including young children, are among the least representative populations one could find for generalizing about humans. Many of these findings involve domains that are associated with fundamental aspects of psychology, motivation, and behavior - hence, there are no obvious a priori grounds for claiming that a particular behavioral phenomenon is universal based on sampling from a single subpopulation. Overall, these empirical patterns suggests that we need to be less cavalier in addressing questions of human nature on the basis of data drawn from this particularly thin, and rather unusual, slice of humanity. We close by proposing ways to structurally re-organize the behavioral sciences to best tackle these challenges.},

Computer software which operates in the manner of a chart parser using this grammar has been implemented, capable of deriving a matrix of reduction possibilities, in polynomial time, from a representation of the score. A full reduction of the extract can be discovered by selecting a tree from this matrix. The number of possible valid reductions for even short extracts is found to be extremely large, so criteria are required to distinguish good reductions from bad ones. To find such criteria, themes from five Mozart piano sonatas are analysed and samples of 'good' reductions (defined by reference to pre-existing analyses of these themes) are compared with randomly sampled reductions. Nine criteria are thereby derived, which can be applied in the process of parsing and selecting a reduction. The results are promising, but the process is still too computationally expensive--only extracts of a few bars in length can be reduced--and more extensive testing is required before the system can be properly claimed to perform automatic Schenkerian analysis.},

Indeed, while in general the anal- ogy of music and language has taken a beating, the unabashed use of "syntax" as a technical term has only increased steadily. 1 First put to extensive use by Hugo Riemann in his book Musikalische Syntaxis (1877) in an attempt to describe chord progression in western music, the term now embraces almost any kind of abstracted relationship among musical phenomena in a composition. "Relationship" can be virtually synonymous with "structure," and since structure has been the operative paradigm par excellence in music theory for some decades, the attraction of the concept of syntax, with its connotations of structures developed in real time, is easy to understand.2 In fact, when Chomsky's generative grammar seemed to have elevated exactly that part of linguistic study into a science in the late 1950s, just at the time when both high logical positivism and serial composition were reaching their high-water marks, the adoption of "syntax" by musicians was probably inevitable. But when we adopt "musical syn- tax," are we getting anything more than a modish synonym for "musi- cal structure"? What should the analogy really import from languag},

The analysis shows that rappers possess detailed implicit knowledge about speech sounds that is largely irrelevant to the sound pattern of their particular language, but has been argued to play a role in constraining possible sound systems across all human languages. We argue that rhyme data are related to phonological typology because many phonological patterns involve the neutralization of contrasts in contexts where they are less perceptible, and rhyme involves implicit judgments of perceptual similarity between sounds. The general finding is that sounds are more likely to mismatch in a rhyme in those contexts where the contrast between the sounds is more likely to neutralize cross-linguistically, even though the contrasts studied here do not neutralize in these contexts in English. The results contribute to the evidence for detailed implicit phonetic knowledge and bear on the issue of synchronic explanation in linguistic theory.},

The introduction considers the relationship between some of these results and the acoustics of musical tones. The next section reviews studies that take a cross-cultural approach. This is followed by a summary of computational models that attempt to characterize the dynamics of tonality perception, particularly how listeners abstract a sense of key and how it changes over time. This is followed by a descrip- tion of recent work at the intersection of music theory and music cognition. The final section considers the prospects for studying tonality with brain imaging techniques.},

	abstract = {It is often claimed that music and language share a process of hierarchical structure building, a mental “syntax”. Although several lines of research point to commonalities, and possibly a shared syntactic component, differences between “language syntax” and “music syntax” can also be found at several levels: conveyed meaning, and the atoms of combination, for example. To bring music and language closer to one another, some researchers have suggested a comparison between music and phonology (‘phonological syntax’), but here too, one quickly arrives at a situation of intriguing similarities and obvious differences. In this paper we suggest that a fruitful comparison between the two domains could benefit from taking the grammar of action into account. In particular, we suggest that what is called “syntax” can be investigated in terms of goal of action, action planning, motor control, and sensory-motor integration. At this level of comparison, we suggest that some of the differences between language and music could be explained in terms of different goals reflected in the hierarchical structures of action planning: the hierarchical structures of music arise to achieve goals with a strong relation to the affective-gestural system encoding tension-relaxation patterns as well as socio-intentional system, whereas hierarchical structures in language are embedded in a conceptual system that gives rise to compositional meaning. Similarities between music and language are most clear in the way several hierarchical plans for executing action are processed in time and sequentially integrated to achieve various goals.},

The tasks were performed first on the entire piece and then on smaller sections from the beginning. Exp 4, with 24 listeners who varied in musical training, examined the extent to which tension judgments were influenced by performed tempo and dynamics. Results are considered in light of the metaphor of tension applied to music and the analogy between music and linguistic discourse. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2004 APA, all rights reserved)},

An explanation is offered for these phenomena, using the theory of uniform infor- mation density. This theory states that communication is optimal when the density of information (the nega- tive log of probability) maintains a consistent, moderate level. The repetition of a pattern of intervals is (in some circumstances, at least) highly probable; in some cases, the information density of such repetitions may be undesirably low. The composer can balance this low information by injecting a high-information (i.e., low- probability) element into the repetition such as a large interval or a chromatic note. A perceptual model is proposed, showing how the probabilities of intervals, scale degrees, and repetition might be calculated and combined.},

Nontraditional rules aris- ing from the derivation are shown to predict formerly unnoticed aspects of voice-leading practice. In addition to the core perceptual principles, several auxiliary principles are described. These auxiliary principles are occasionally linked to voice-leading practice and may be regarded as com- positional “options” that shape the music-making in perceptually unique ways. It is suggested that these auxiliary principles distinguish different types of part writing, such as polyphony, homophony, and close har- mony.

We then used voxelwise models to examine the cortical representation of 1,705 object and action categories. The first few dimensions of the underlying semantic space were recovered from the fit models by principal components analysis. Projection of the recovered semantic space onto cortical flat maps shows that semantic selectivity is organized into smooth gradients that cover much of visual and nonvisual cortex. Furthermore, both the recovered semantic space and the cortical organization of the space are shared across different individuals.},

Here, we report a crosscultural study with participants from a native African population (Mafa) and Western participants, with both groups being naive to the music of the other respective culture. Experiment 1 investigated the ability to recognize three basic emotions (happy, sad, scared/fearful) expressed in Western music. Results show that the Mafas recognized happy, sad, and scared/fearful Western music excerpts above chance, indicating that the expression of these basic emotions in Western music can be recognized universally. Experiment 2 examined how a spectral manipulation of original, naturalistic music affects the perceived pleasantness of music in Western as well as in Mafa listeners. The spectral manipulation modified, among other factors, the sensory dissonance of the music. The data show that both groups preferred original Western music and also original Mafa music over their spectrally manipulated versions. It is likely that the sensory dissonance produced by the spectral manipulation was at least partly responsible for this effect, suggesting that consonance and permanent sensory dissonance universally influence the perceived pleasantness of music. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

For example, in a statistical study by Rohrmeier of the frequencies of diatonic chord progressions in Bach chorales, chord II was five times more likely to follow chord IV than to precede it; chord I followed chord V twice as often as preceding it, and so on. This research draws together two existing lines of research with the aim of showing how local and possibly global dependency relationships specified in Rohrmeier's generative grammar may be linked to and supported by chord attraction levels as specified in Woolhouse's pitch attraction model. It is argued that, to a significant degree, the transitional regularities of chords in tonal music can be explained and understood in terms of generative rules of tonal harmony and pitch attraction. Empirical evidence is provided which supports the notion that chord transition asymmetries in Bach chorales are linked to chord attraction, mediated by an underlying syntactic process.},

To this end we acquired a profile of semantic associations (such as, for example, fight, river, etc.) to Western musical pieces from each participant, and then compared these profiles across cultural groups. Results show that the association profiles between Mafa, an ethnic group from northern Cameroon, and Western listeners are different, but that the Mafa have a consistent association profile, indicating that their associations are strongly informed by their enculturation. Results also show that listeners for whom Western music is novel, but whose association profile was more similar to the mean Western music association profile also had a greater appreciation of the Western music. The data thus show that, to some degree, iconic meaning transcends cultural boundaries, with a high inter-individual variance, probably because meaning in music is prone to be overwritten by individual and cultural experience.},

The model emphasizes that over historic time the music in a given culture can ‘‘dock into’’ and ‘‘dock out of’’ cues that are universally perceived, shifting its potential for cross-cultural per- ception and interaction. While this model accounts for music ethnological evidence reviewed here, it also explains why universals of music perception cannot simply be determined by specifying the common denominator between the formal music features of all cultures.

To know whether a non-significant result counts against a theory, or if it just indicates data insensitivity, researchers must use one of: power, intervals (such as confidence or credibility intervals), or else an indicator of the relative evidence for one theory over another, such as a Bayes factor. I argue Bayes factors allow theory to be linked to data in a way that overcomes the weaknesses of the other approaches. Specifically, Bayes factors use the data themselves to determine their sensitivity in distinguishing theories (unlike power), and they make use of those aspects of a theory’s predictions that are often easiest to specify (unlike power and intervals, which require specifying the minimal interesting value in order to address theory). Bayes factors provide a coherent approach to determining whether non-significant results support a null hypothesis over a theory, or whether the data are just insensitive. They allow accepting and rejecting the null hypothesis to be put on an equal footing. Concrete examples are provided to indicate the range of application of a simple online Bayes calculator, which reveal both the strengths and weaknesses of Bayes factors.},

Rather, it comprises a set of neurally isolable processing components, each having the potential to be specialized for music. Here we propose a functional architecture for music processing that captures the typical properties of modular organization. The model rests essentially on the analysis of music-related deficits in neurologically impaired individuals, but provides useful guidelines for exploring the music faculty in normal people, using methods such as neuroimaging.},

	abstract = {The paper revisits results from scale theory through the study of modes. Point of departure is the nested hierarchy of triads em- bedded into diatonic modes embedded into the chromatic scale. Generic diatonic triads can be described as stacks of thirds or as stacks of triple- fifths. These two possibilities lead to different generalizations and it is argued that the latter possibility is better suited for the understanding of harmonic tonality. Three types of well-formed modes are investigated: Simple Modes, Chain Modes, and Diazeuctic Modes. Chain Modes and Diazeuctic modes are the modal counterparts of the two types of reduced scales with the Partitioning Property in Clough and Myerson (1985), as well as of Agmon’s (1989) types A and B of generalized diatonic systems.},

	abstract = {The generality of findings implicating secondary auditory areas in auditory imagery was tested by using a timbre imagery task with fMRI. Another aim was to test whether activity in supplementary motor area (SMA) seen in prior studies might have been related to subvocalization. Participants with moderate musical background were scanned while making similarity judgments about the timbre of heard or imagined musical instrument sounds. The critical control condition was a visual imagery task. The pattern of judgments in perceived and imagined conditions was similar, suggesting that perception and imagery access similar cognitive representations of timbre. As expected, judgments of heard timbres, relative to the visual imagery control, activated primary and secondary auditory areas with some right-sided asymmetry. Timbre imagery also activated secondary auditory areas relative to the visual imagery control, although less strongly, in accord with previous data. Significant overlap was observed in these regions between perceptual and imagery conditions. Because the visual control task resulted in deactivation of auditory areas relative to a silent baseline, we interpret the timbre imagery effect as a reversal of that deactivation. Despite the lack of an obvious subvocalization component to timbre imagery, some activity in SMA was observed, suggesting that SMA may have a more general role in imagery beyond any motor component. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The intent here was to investigate whether the affect of music can also contribute to a story's comprehension by guiding the course of selective attending and providing a more elaborative encoding of characters' actions, motivations, and inherent temperament. These ideas were examined by presenting participants with three ambiguous film clips accompanied by positive, negative, and no music. Immediately after viewing each clip, some participants were asked to extrapolate the film's ending, evaluate the personality and motivations of the main character(s), and complete a series of bipolar adjective ratings about the film's actions. In addition, other participants returned a week later for a surprise recognition test that assessed their memory for certain objects within each film. Results revealed that relative to the control group of no music, positive and negative music significantly biased viewers' interpretation and subsequent remembering of a film in a moodcongruent fashion. These findings are discussed in terms of the schematic influences of music upon the cognitive processing of visual scenes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2004 APA, all rights reserved)},

In a preliminary study and in the main experiment, subjects saw the film accompanied by one of the two soundtracks or with no soundtrack, or they heard one of the two soundtracks alone. In the main experiment, Semantic Differential judgements on Activity and Potency dimensions, obtained for the music, predicted effects of the soundtracks on corresponding ratings of the film as compared to ratings in a no soundtrack condition. As well, ratings on the Activity dimension of the film characters themselves were altered by the soundtracks. It is hypothesized that congruent auditory and visual structure directs the encoding of particular visual features of the film. In addition, associations generated by the music provide a context for the interpretation of the action in the film. As a result, stimulus features and concepts that are initially encoded as disjunctive conjoin in perception and memory.},

	abstract = {One of the major reasons why people find music so enjoyable is its emotional impact. Creating emotion-based playlists is a natural way of organizing music. The usability of online music streaming services could be greatly improved by developing emotion-based access methods, and automatic music emotion recognition (MER) is the most quick and feasible way of achieving it. When resorting to music for emotional regulation purposes, users are interested in the MER method to predict their induced, or felt emotion. The progress of MER in this area is impeded by the absence of publicly accessible ground-truth data on musically induced emotion. Also, there is no consensus on the question which emotional model best fits the demands of the users and can provide an unambiguous linguistic framework to describe musical emotions. In this paper we address these problems by creating a sizeable publicly available dataset of 400 musical excerpts from four genres annotated with induced emotion. We collected the data using an online “game with a purpose” Emotify, which attracted a big and varied sample of participants. We employed a nine item domain-specific emotional model GEMS (Geneva Emotional Music Scale). In this paper we analyze the collected data and report agreement of participants on different categories of GEMS. We also analyze influence of extra-musical factors on induced emotion (gender, mood, music preferences). We suggest that modifications in GEMS model are necessary.},

These restrictions are shown to be increasingly heavy in the sense that the languages that can be generated by grammars meeting a given restriction constitute a proper subset of those that can be generated by grammars meeting the preceding restriction. Various formulations of phrase structure description are considered, and the source of their excess generative power over finite state sources is investigated in greater detail.},

	abstract = {Instrumental music and language are both syntactic systems, employing complex, hierar- chically-structured sequences built using implicit structural norms. This organization allows listeners to understand the role of individual words or tones in the context of an unfolding sentence or melody. Previous studies suggest that the brainmechanisms of syntactic pro- cessing may be partly shared between music and language. However, functional neuroim- aging evidence for anatomical overlap of brain activity involved in linguistic and musical syntactic processing has been lacking. In the present study we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in conjunction with an interference paradigm based on sung sen- tences. We show that the processing demands of musical syntax (harmony) and language syntax interact in Broca’s area in the left inferior frontal gyrus (without leading to music and language main effects). A language main effect in Broca’s area only emerged in the com- plex music harmony condition, suggesting that (with our stimuli and tasks) a language effect only becomes visible under conditions of increased demands on shared neural resources. In contrast to previous studies, our design allows us to rule out that the observed neural interaction is due to: (1) general attention mechanisms, as a psychoacoustic auditory anom- aly behaved unlike the harmonic manipulation, (2) error processing, as the language and themusic stimuli contained no structural errors. The current results thus suggest that two different cognitive domains—music and language—might draw on the same high level syn- tactic integration resources in Broca’s area. Introduction},

	abstract = {This article presents a self-organizing map (SOM) neural network model of tonality based on experimentally quantified tonal hierarchies. A toroidal representation of key distances is recovered in which keys are located near their neighbors on the circle of fifths, and both parallel and relative major/minor key pairs are proximal. The map is used to represent dynamic changes in the sense of key as cues to key become more or less clear and modulations occur. Two models, one using tone distributions and the other using tone transitions, are proposed for key-finding. The tone transition model takes both pitch and temporal distance between tones into account. Both models produce results highly comparable to those of musically trained listeners, who performed a probe tone task for ten nine-chord sequences. A distributed mapping of tonality is used to visualize activation patterns that change over time. The location and spread of this activation pattern is similar for experimental results and the key-finding model.},

	abstract = {Recursion involves an inherent tradeoff between simplicity and goodness-of-fit: a grammar with recursive rules might be simpler than one without, but will predict the sentences in any finite corpus less exactly. As a result, one cannot conclude that any particular grammar or grammatical rule is recursive, given a corpus, without some way to quantify and calculate this tradeoff in a principled way. We present a Bayesian framework for performing rational inference that enables us to quantitatively evaluate grammars with and without recursive rules and normatively determine which best describe the sentences in a corpus of child-directed spoken English. Our results suggest three main points. First, they suggest that rational principles would favor a grammar with a specific type of recursive rule, even if there are relatively few instances of particular recursively-generated sentences in the input. Second, they suggest that the optimal grammar may occupy a representational middle ground between fully recursive and non- recursive. Finally, our results suggest that the optimal grammar may represent subject NPs distinctly from object NPs. We suggest that our method and insights can be usefully applied to address other questions in linguistics and the study of recursion.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: Small pitch movement is known to characterize sadness in speech prosody. Small melodic interval sizes have also been observed in nominally sad music —at least in the case of Western music. Starting with melodies in the major mode, a study is reported which examines the effect of different scale modifications on the average interval size. Compared with all other possible scale modifications, lowering the third and sixth scale tones from the major scale is shown to provide an optimum or near optimum way of reducing the average melodic interval size for a large diverse sample of major-mode melodies. The results are consistent with the view that Western melodic organization and the major-minor polarity are co-adapted, and that the structure of the minor mode contributes to the evoking, expressing or representation of sadness for listeners enculturated to the major scale.},

	abstract = {Processing of meaning is critical for language perception, and therefore the majority of research on meaning processing has focused on the semantic, lexical, conceptual, and propositional processing of language. However, music is another a means of communication, and meaning also emerges from the interpretation of musical information. This article provides a framework for the investigation of the processing of musical meaning, and reviews neuroscience studies investigating this issue. These studies reveal two neural correlates of meaning processing, the N400 and the N5 (which are both components of the event-related electric brain potential). Here I argue that the N400 can be elicited by musical stimuli due to the processing of extra-musical meaning, whereas the N5 can be elicited due to the processing of intra-musical meaning. Notably, whereas the N400 can be elicited by both linguistic and musical stimuli, the N5 has so far only been observed for the processing of meaning in music. Thus, knowledge about both the N400 and the N5 can advance our understanding of how the human brain processes meaning information. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

We find that no finite-state Markov process that produces symbols with transition from state to state can serve as an English grammar. Furthermore, the particular subclass of such processes that produce{\textless}tex{\textgreater}n{\textless}/tex{\textgreater}-order statistical approximations to English do not come closer, with increasing{\textless}tex{\textgreater}n{\textless}/tex{\textgreater}, to matching the output of an English grammar. We formalize-the notions of "phrase structure" and show that this gives us a method for describing language which is essentially more powerful, though still representable as a rather elementary type of finite-state process. Nevertheless, it is successful only when limited to a small subset of simple sentences. We study the formal properties of a set of grammatical transformations that carry sentences with phrase structure into new sentences with derived phrase structure, showing that transformational grammars are processes of the same elementary type as phrase-structure grammars; that the grammar of English is materially simplified if phrase structure description is limited to a kernel of simple sentences from which all other sentences are constructed by repeated transformations; and that this view of linguistic structure gives a certain insight into the use and understanding of language.},

Over the last twenty years, the field of implicit learning has come to embody ongoing questioning about three fundamental issues in the cognitive sciences: (1) consciousness (how one should conceptualize and measure the relationships between conscious and unconscious cognition); (2) mental representation (in particular, the complex issue of abstraction); and (3) modularity and the architecture of the cognitive system (whether one should think of implicit and explicit learning as being subtended by separable systems of the brain or not). Computational modeling plays a central role in addressing these issues. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2009 APA, all rights reserved)},

Thus we can relate the two kinds of informa- tion and predict perception data from production data. In this approach, the contrast between rhythm percep- tion and production data, taken from different studies in the literature, was shown almost to disappear, assem- bling independent prior probabilities from counts of patterns in corpora of musical scores, or from a theoret- ical measure of rhythmic complexity. The success of this Bayesian formalization may be interpreted as an optimal adaptation of our perceptual system to the environment in which the produced rhythms occur.},

	abstract = {In this response to Pinker and Jackendoff's critique, we extend our previous framework for discussion of language evolution, clarifying certain distinctions and elaborating on a number of points. In the first half of the paper, we reiterate that profitable research into the biology and evolution of language requires fractionation of "language" into component mechanisms and interfaces, a non-trivial endeavor whose results are unlikely to map onto traditional disciplinary boundaries. Our terminological distinction between FLN and FLB is intended to help clarify misunderstandings and aid interdisciplinary rapprochement. By blurring this distinction, Pinker and Jackendoff mischaracterize our hypothesis 3 which concerns only FLN, not "language" as a whole. Many of their arguments and examples are thus irrelevant to this hypothesis. Their critique of the minimalist program is for the most part equally irrelevant, because very few of the arguments in our original paper were tied to this program; in an online appendix we detail the deep inaccuracies in their characterization of this program. Concerning evolution, we believe that Pinker and Jackendoff's emphasis on the past adaptive history of the language faculty is misplaced. Such questions are unlikely to be resolved empirically due to a lack of relevant data, and invite speculation rather than research. Preoccupation with the issue has retarded progress in the field by diverting research away from empirical questions, many of which can be addressed with comparative data. Moreover, offering an adaptive hypothesis as an alternative to our hypothesis concerning mechanisms is a logical error, as questions of function are independent of those concerning mechanism. The second half of our paper consists of a detailed response to the specific data discussed by Pinker and Jackendoff. Although many of their examples are irrelevant to our original paper and arguments, we find several areas of substantive disagreement that could be resolved by future empirical research. We conclude that progress in understanding the evolution of language will require much more empirical research, grounded in modern comparative biology, more interdisciplinary collaboration, and much less of the adaptive storytelling and phylogenetic speculation that has traditionally characterized the field.},

This implicitly acquired tonal knowledge allows nonmusician listeners to perceive relationships among musical events and to develop expectations for future events that then influence the processing of these events. The musical priming paradigm is one method of the indirect investigation of listeners' tonal knowledge. It investigates the influence of a preceding context (with its musical structures and relationships) on the processing of a musical target event, without asking participants for direct evaluations. Behavioral priming data have provided evidence for facilitated processing of musically related events in comparison to unrelated and less-related events. The sensitivity of implicit investigations is further shown by I.R., a patient with severe amusia, showing spared implicit knowledge of music. Finally, the priming paradigm allows us to investigate the neural correlates of musical structure processing. Two fMRI studies reported the implication of inferior frontal regions in musical priming, contrasting related and unrelated events, as well as finer structural manipulations contrasting in-key events.},

The present study investigated how music processing is influenced by a preceding musical context, affected by the task relevance of unexpected chords, and influenced by the degree and the probability of violation. Four experiments were conducted in which "nonmusicians" listened to chord sequences, which infrequently contained a chord violating the sound expectancy of listeners. Integration of in-key chords into the musical context was reflected as a late negative-frontal deflection in the ERPs. This negative deflection declined towards the end of a chord sequence, reflecting normal buildup of musical context. Brain waves elicited by chords with unexpected notes revealed two ERP effects: an early right-hemispheric preponderant-anterior negativity, which was taken to reflect the violation of sound expectancy; and a late bilateral-frontal negativity. The late negativity was larger compared to in-key chords and taken to reflect the higher degree of integration needed for unexpected chords. The early right-anterior negativity (ERAN) was unaffected by the task relevance of unexpected chords. The amplitudes of both early and late negativities were found to be sensitive to the degree of musical expectancy induced by the preceding harmonic context, and to the probability for deviant acoustic events. The employed experimental design opens a new field for the investigation of music processing. Results strengthen the hypothesis of an implicit musical ability of the human brain.},

In the present experiment, such chords elicited an early effect, taken as the magnetic equivalent of the ERAN (termed mERAN). The source of mERAN activity was localized in Broca's area and its right-hemisphere homologue, areas involved in syntactic analysis during auditory language comprehension.

A reanalysis of data reported by Cuddy and Lunney (1995) provided similar results. When the principles of the I-R model were submitted to a principal-compo- nents analysis, a solution containing three orthogonal (uncorrelated) fac- tors retained the accuracy of the model but was inferior to the revised model. A separate principal-components analysis of the predictors of the revised model yielded a two-factor solution that did not compromise the revised model's predictive power. Consequently, an even simpler model of melodic expectancy was derived. These results provide further evi- dence that redundancy in the I-R model can be eliminated without loss of predictive accuracy.},

Here, we review and compare behavioural and neural data on temporal and sequential processing during beat perception and entrainment tasks in macaques (including direct neural recording and local field potential (LFP)) and humans (including fMRI, EEG and MEG). These abilities rest upon a distributed set of circuits that include the motor cortico-basal-ganglia-thalamo-cortical (mCBGT) circuit, where the supplementary motor cortex (SMA) and the putamen are critical cortical and subcortical nodes, respectively. In addition, a cortical loop between motor and auditory areas, connected through delta and beta oscillatory activity, is deeply involved in these behaviours, with motor regions providing the predictive timing needed for the perception of, and entrainment to, musical rhythms. The neural discharge rate and the LFP oscillatory activity in the gamma- and beta-bands in the putamen and SMA of monkeys are tuned to the duration of intervals produced during a beat synchronization-continuation task (SCT). Hence, the tempo during beat synchronization is represented by different interval-tuned cells that are activated depending on the produced interval. In addition, cells in these areas are tuned to the serial-order elements of the SCT. Thus, the underpinnings of beat synchronization are intrinsically linked to the dynamics of cell populations tuned for duration and serial order throughout the mCBGT. We suggest that a cross-species comparison of behaviours and the neural circuits supporting them sets the stage for a new generation of neurally grounded computational models for beat perception and synchronization.},

These structures enable a durational realization. Phonological stress also helps assign the poem's normative melodic contour. Finally, the similarities and differences in sound repetition are given hierarchical structure by means of musical prolongational theory. These formal parallels suggest a corresponding realization in brain localization and function. Evidence from the neuropsychological literature is cited in support of this view.

Recent studies have highlighted that the behavioural relevance of stimuli to animals and the relation of experimental procedures to their natural behaviour can have a large impact on the type of results that can be obtained for a given species. Through reviewing laboratory findings on animal auditory perception and behaviour, as well as relevant findings on natural behaviour, we provide evidence that both traditional laboratory studies and studies relating to natural behaviour are needed to answer the problem of musicality. Traditional laboratory studies use synthetic stimuli that provide more control than more naturalistic studies, and are in many ways suitable to test the perceptual abilities of animals. However, naturalistic studies are essential to inform us as to what might constitute relevant stimuli and parameters to test with laboratory studies, or why we may or may not expect certain stimulus manipulations to be relevant. These two approaches are both vital in the comparative study of musicality.},

	abstract = {Prediction or expectancy is thought to play an important role in both music and language processing. However, prediction is currently studied independently in the two domains, limiting research on relations between predictive mechanisms in music and language. One limitation is a difference in how expectancy is quantified. In language, expectancy is typically measured using the cloze probability task, in which listeners are asked to complete a sentence fragment with the first word that comes to mind. In contrast, previous production-based studies of melodic expectancy have asked participants to sing continuations following only one to two notes. We have developed a melodic cloze probability task in which listeners are presented with the beginning of a novel tonal melody (5–9 notes) and are asked to sing the note they expect to come next. Half of the melodies had an underlying harmonic structure designed to constrain expectations for the next note, based on an implied authentic cadence (AC) within themelody. Each such ‘authentic cadence’ melody was matched to a ‘non-cadential’ (NC) melody matched in terms of length, rhythmand melodic contour, but differing in implied harmonic structure. Participants showed much greater consistency in the notes sung following AC vs. NC melodies on average. However, significant variation in degree of consistency was observed within both AC and NCmelodies. Analysis of individual melodies suggests that pitch prediction in tonal melodies depends on the interplay of local factors just prior to the target note (e.g., local pitch interval patterns) and larger-scale structural relationships (e.g., melodic patterns and implied harmonic structure). We illustrate how the melodic clozemethod can be used to test a computational model ofmelodic expectation. Future uses for the method include exploring the interplay of different factors shaping melodic expectation, and designing experiments that compare the cognitive mechanisms of prediction in music and language.},

We illustrate and support our argument by reference to whale and bird song; these independently evolved biological signal mechanisms objectively share surface properties with human behaviours generally called 'creative'. Studying them may elucidate mechanisms underlying human creativity; we outline a research programme to do so.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a statistical model of key induction from given short harmony progressions and its application in modelling dynamics of on-line key induction in harmonic progressions with a sliding window approach. Using a database of Bachs chorales, the model induces keys and key profiles for given harmonic contexts and accounts for related music theoretical concepts of harmonic ambiguity and revision. Some common results from music analytical practice can be accounted for with the model. The sliding window key induction gives evidence of cases in which key is established or modulation is recognised even though neither dominant nor leading tone was involved. This may give rise to a more flexible, probabilistic interpretation of key which would encompass ambiguity and under-determination. In addition, a novel method of harmonically adequate segmen-tation is presented.1},

	abstract = {The paper considers three theories of tonal harmony: root-motion theories, scale-degree theories and function theories, in order to determine whether they can produce a simple grammar of elementary tonal harmony, i. e. a simple set of principles that generates all and only the standard tonal chord progressions. The study is based on the analysis of 30 of Bach's chorale harmonizations in the major mode. Theories of root motion involve a principle of scale-degree symmetry, which asserts that all diatonic harmonies participate equally in the set of allowable root motions, and a principle of root-motion asymmetry, which claims that certain types of root motions are preferable to others. Neither is entirely verified. Theories of scale degrees, examined here in the form of a first-order Markov model, do a suprisingly good job of approximating the progressions of elementary diatonic harmony, much better than the pure root-motion perspective. The function view (envisaged here without consideration of its possible psychological implications) merely adds that some chords behave in similar enough ways to justify grouping them together in categories. The scale-degree theory therefore yields the best grammar of tonal harmony. The root-motion theory is too restrictive and the function theory overly permissive.},

Related aims were to explore how the different mechanisms of music-induced emotions are involved in sadness induced by familiar, self-selected music and unfamiliar, experimenter-selected music, and whether the susceptibility to music-induced sadness is associated with trait empathy. One hundred twenty participants were randomly assigned into four conditions with different tasks: listening to unfamiliar sad or neutral music, or to self-selected sad music, or recalling a sad autobiographical event and writing about it. The induced affective states were measured indirectly using a word recall task and a judgment task where participants rated the emotions expressed by pictures depicting facial expressions. The results indicate that listening to sad music can indeed induce changes in emotion-related memory and judgment. However, this effect depends, to some extent, on the music’s relevance to the listener, as well as on the personality attributes of the listener. Trait empathy contributed to the susceptibility to sadness induced by unfamiliar music, while autobiographical memories contributed to sadness induced by self-selected music.},

	abstract = {In the early twentieth century systematic musicology, which was based on the comparative method, played a prominent role in the discipline: however it was appropriated by the Nazis and fell out of favour after the war. It was replaced by ethnomusicology and structuralist music theory, both of which emphasized the individual context (cultural or structural) and eschewed comparison between contexts. Both also developed an epistemology based on the generation of meaning through the act of "experiencing and understanding music" (Titon 1997: 87): this epistemology, characteristic of cultural musicology and theory (CMT) in general, is quite distinct from that of the cognitive sciences of music (CSM). The otherwise confusing variety of musicological practices subsumed under the category "systematic musicology", as set out in Honing's article on which this is a commentary, can be usefully seen in terms of two distinct dimensions, those of method and of epistemology. It follows from this that empirical methods are as consistent with, and as potentially valuable to, CMT as they are to CSM, and that EMR has the potential to reach both constituencies.},

The empirical, or observational component of research may nevertheless be understood in slightly different ways, depending on whether there is only one observer (or many), and depending on whether the observations are treated as falling within a single category (or not). It is argued that either the observer or the observational category has to be assumed constant in order that the research may be called truly empirical.

	abstract = {The sound of music may arouse profound emotions in listeners. But such experiences seem to involve a 'paradox', namely that music - an abstract form of art, which appears removed from our concerns in everyday life - can arouse emotions - biologically evolved reactions related to human survival. How are these (seemingly) non-commensurable phenomena linked together? Key is to understand the processes through which sounds are imbued with meaning. It can be argued that the survival of our ancient ancestors depended on their ability to detect patterns in sounds, derive meaning from them, and adjust their behavior accordingly. Such an ecological perspective on sound and emotion forms the basis of a recent multi-level framework that aims to explain emotional responses to music in terms of a large set of psychological mechanisms. The goal of this review is to offer an updated and expanded version of the framework that can explain both 'everyday emotions' and 'aesthetic emotions'. The revised framework - referred to as BRECVEMA - includes eight mechanisms: Brain Stem Reflex, Rhythmic Entrainment, Evaluative Conditioning, Contagion, Visual Imagery, Episodic Memory, Musical Expectancy, and Aesthetic Judgment. In this review, it is argued that all of the above mechanisms may be directed at information that occurs in a 'musical event' (i.e., a specific constellation of music, listener, and context). Of particular significance is the addition of a mechanism corresponding to aesthetic judgments of the music, to better account for typical 'appreciation emotions' such as admiration and awe. Relationships between aesthetic judgments and other mechanisms are reviewed based on the revised framework. It is suggested that the framework may contribute to a long-needed reconciliation between previous approaches that have conceptualized music listeners' responses in terms of either 'everyday emotions' or 'aesthetic emotions'. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {This paper provides a theoretical framework upon which to build a system for chordal analysis of music. We establish that, in the worst case, the partitioning and labeling of harmonies in tonal music is O(2N), where N is number of notes in a piece of music. We show that, when segments of the music can be analyzed locally, and a segment scoring metric can be found that is both additive and transitive, the problem becomes O(N2). Under these constraints, the problem is cast as finding the best path through a single- source directed acyclic graph, which can be solved in O(E + V) time. This translates to a worst-case time complexity of O(N2) for our problem. We then show that the results of the O(N2) search can be closely approximated through the use of a heuristic that allows O(N) time search. The results of the heuristic search are then compared to exhaustive graph search and the results of analyses by existing systems by Winograd (Winograd 1968), Maxwell (Maxwell 1992), and Temperley and Sleator (Temperley and Sleator 1999).},

At each level of the hierarchy, elements are organized as structural units in accordance with gestalt principles such as proximity and good continuation. Further, elements that are present at each hierarchical level are elaborated by further elements to form structural units at the next-lower level, until the lowest level is reached. Processing advantages include the following: (a) redundancy of representation, (b) use of distinct alphabets at different structural levels, and (c) representations formed in accordance with the laws of figural goodness.

	abstract = {Music perception builds on expectancy in harmony, melody, and rhythm. Neural responses to the violations of such expectations are observed in event-related potentials (ERPs) measured using electroencephalography. Most previous ERP studies demonstrating sensitivity to musical violations used stimuli that were temporally regular and musically structured, with less-frequent deviant events that differed from a specific expectation in some feature such as pitch, harmony, or rhythm. Here, we asked whether expectancies about Western musical scale are strong enough to elicit ERP deviance components. Specifically, we explored whether pitches inconsistent with an established scale context elicit deviant components even though equally rare pitches that fit into the established context do not, and even when their timing is unpredictable. We used Markov chains to create temporally irregular pseudo-random sequences of notes chosen from one of two diatonic scales. The Markov pitch-transition probabilities resulted in sequences that favored notes within the scale, but that lacked clear melodic, harmonic, or rhythmic structure. At the random positions, the sequence contained probe tones that were either within the established scale or were out of key. Our subjects ignored the note sequences, watching a self-selected silent movie with subtitles. Compared to the in-key probes, the out-of-key probes elicited a significantly larger P2 ERP component. Results show that random note sequences establish expectations of the "first-order" statistical property of musical key, even in listeners not actively monitoring the sequences.},

	abstract = {In this series of experiments, evidence was found for a complex psychological representation of musical pitch. The results of a scaling study, in which subjects judged the similarities between pairs of tones presented in an explicitly tonal context, suggest that musical listeners extract a pattern of relationships among tones that is determined not only by pitch height and chroma, but also by membership in the major triad chord and the diatonic scale associated with the tonal system of the context. Multidimensional scaling of the similarity ratings gave a three-dimensional conical structure around which the tones were ordered according to pitch height. The major triad components formed a closely related cluster near the vertex of the cone; the remaining diatonic scale tones formed a less closely related subset farther from the vertex; and, the nondiatonic tones, still farther from the vertex, were widely dispersed. The results also suggest that, in the psychological representation, tones less closely related to the tonality are less stable than tones closely related to the tonality, and that the representation incorporates the tendency for unstable tones to move toward the more stable tones in time, reflecting the dynamic character of musical tones. In the similarity ratings of the scaling study, tones less related to the tonality were judged more similar to tones more related to the tonality than the reverse temporal order. Furthermore, in a delayed recognition task memory performance for nondiatonic tones was less accurate than for diatonic tones, and nondiatonic tones were more often confused with diatonic tones than diatonic tones were confused with nondiatonic tones. These results indicate the tonality-specific nature of the psychological representation and argue that the perception of music depends not only on psychoacoustic properties of the tones, but also on processes that relate the tones to one another through contact with a well-defined and complex psychological representation of musical pitch.},

The rule systems also show a number of similarities with the Chomsky \& Halle (1968) generative phonology of English. For instance, the proce- dures used for deriving a stress contour from a tree diagram are almost identical. Moreover, in sentences as in melodies this stress, or prominence contour is of decisive importance to the generation of the surface structure, such as meter, harmony, and sequences of pitches.

Adults remember melodies better, however, when they are presented in a biologically significant timbre (i.e., the human voice) than in various instrumental timbres (Weiss, Trehub, \& Schellenberg, 2012). We examined the impact of vocal timbre on children’s processing of melodies. In Study 1, 9- to 11-year-olds listened to 16 unfamiliar folk melodies (4 each of voice, piano, banjo, or marimba). They subsequently listened to the same melodies and 16 timbre-matched foils, and judged whether each melody was old or new. Vocal melodies were recognized better than instrumental melodies, which did not differ from one another, and the vocal advantage was consistent across age. In Study 2, 5- to 6-year-olds and 7- to 8-year-olds were tested with a simplified design that included only vocal and piano melodies. Both age groups successfully differentiated old from new melodies, but memory was more accurate for the older group. The older children recognized vocal melodies better than piano melodies, whereas the younger children tended to label vocal melodies as old whether they were old or new. The results provide the first evidence of differential processing of vocal and instrumental melodies in childhood.},

Our method is based in part on a key-finding algorithm developed by Krumhansl and Schmuckler (Krumhansl, 1990) and is applied in a sliding-window fashion, producing a sequence of key assignments. These assignments constitute so-called class data in that they possess no natural numerical properties and can be considered as arising from a classification process. A new approach for smoothing such class data using graph theoretic norm estimates is applied to the sequence of key assignments. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated by comparing it with judgments made by experts. Then, the problem is placed in the context of machine recognition of music patterns. We discuss a music pattern recognition system proposed by Coyle and Shmulevich (1998) that relies on robust determination of localized tonal context. This, in turn, allows the system to incorporate perceptual error criteria.},

	abstract = {Cadences are one of the most powerful tools at a film composer’s disposal. The structure and placement of a cadence can shape the emotional arc of a scene, accentuate narratival information, and manipulate generic expectations. Drawing from theories of film genre and cadential definition from Altman (1999) and Caplin (2002), I explore several cinematically significant cadential genres; harmonic routines arising through the convergence of independent musical phenomena that together project a punctuative function. Through processes of attribute substitution and subtraction, a cadential genre can adapt to shifting scoring practices and generic expectations. I showcase four such cadential genres. The mixed plagal cadence imports transcendent harmonic associations from the Romantic era. Phrasal mickey mousing arises through cadential synchronization, as shown in an analysis of Korngold’s Robin Hood. The subtonic half cadence is strongly linked with a specific film genre: the western. Through analysis of Jerome Moross’s subtonic-saturated scores and subsequent adapted and abstracted usages, I show the value of the generic approach to style-based analysis. Lastly, I inspect the chromatically modulating cadential resolution (CMCR): the strategy of initiating a diatonic cadence in one key only for the dominant to discharge onto the tonic of a chromatically related key. Through a variety of intrinsic and contextual traits describable by linear, transformational, and cognitive models, I explain the strong association of CMCRs with cinematic evocations of wonderment. This is illustrated through a case study of Williams’s Jurassic Park.},

	abstract = {Transformational music theory mainly deals with group and group actions on sets, which are usually constituted by chords. For example, neo-Riemannian theory uses the dihedral group D24 to study transformations between major and minor triads, the building blocks of classical and romantic harmony. Since the developments of neo-Riemannian theory, many developments and generalizations have been proposed, based on other sets of chords, other groups, etc. However music theory also face problems for example when defining transformations between chords of different cardinalities, or for transformations that are not necessarily invertible. This paper introduces a categorical construction of musical transformations based on category extensions using groupoids. This can be seen as a generalization of a previous work which aimed at building generalized neo-Riemannian groups of transformations based on group extensions. The categorical extension construction allows the definition of partial transformations between different set-classes. Moreover, it can be shown that the typical wreath products groups of transformations can be recovered from the category extensions by "packaging" operators and considering their composition.},

We show that cultural transmission can magnify weak biases into strong linguistic universals, undermining one of the arguments for strong innate constraints on language learning. As a consequence, the strength of innate biases can be shielded from natural selection, allowing these genes to drift. Furthermore, even when there is no natural selection, cultural transmission can produce apparent adaptations. Cultural transmission thus provides an alternative to traditional nativist and adaptationist explanations for the properties of human languages.},

We present a series of data-oriented parsing (DOP) models that combine these two principles and that are tested on the Penn Treebank and the Essen Folksong Collection. Our experiments show that (1) a combination of the two principles outperforms the use of either of them, and (2) exactly the same model with the same parameter setting achieves maximum accuracy for both language and music.

In our first study (reported here, and referred to as “the Mozart study”), participants with varying levels of musical training were presented with disordered sections of Mozart’s piano sonata K. 570/I in B flat major and asked to rearrange the ten sections into a musically logical coherent whole. A second study (to be reported in Musicae Scientiae issue 16[1]) replicated the task in a different group of participants who listened to Haydn’s piano sonata, Hob: XVI-34/I in E minor. In contrast with previous studies, we do not focus on listeners’ ability to recover the original sonatas. Rather, we explore emergent patterns in their responses using new types of analysis. Our results indicate that listeners show: (1) Some sensitivity to the overall structure of A-B-A’ around the non-stable B section; (2) Non- trivial sensitivity to overall “directionality” through a new type of analysis (“distance score”); (3) Correct grouping and placement of developmental sections possibly related to listener’s sensitivity to musical tension; (4) Sensitivity to opening and closing gestures, thematic similarity and surface cues and; (5) No sensitivity to global harmonic structure.},

The proposed methodology involves free, associative responses as well as responses on semantic variables addressing the imagery. After deriving potential topical structures for a given musical domain from the quantitative results, the structures are substantiated by using them to guide a rule-based, qualitative analysis of the free responses. The approach allows a view to the topical organization of a musical domain in which the identity of each musical topos is fixed in extrinsic terms, by a set of semantic fields that is unique to the topos in question. An application of the approach to contemporary ‘‘motivational’’ production music yields an organiza- tion of such semantic fields into three topical cate- gories—INTIMACY, POTENCY,and SPEED.},

This paper explores the possibilities of big data-based research within the field of music psychology. We illustrate one methodological approach by studying involuntary musical imagery, or earworms in the social networking service Twitter. Our goal was to collect a large natural- istic and culturally diverse database of discussions and to classify the encountered expressions.We describe our method and present results from automatic data classi- fication and sentiment analyses. Over six months, we collected over 80,000 tweets from 173 locations around the world to obtain the most diverse dataset collated to date related to involuntarymusical imagery. Automated classifications categorized 51\% of all tweets gathered, with over 90\% accuracy in each category. The most prominent categories of discussion concerned reporting earworm experiences, hyperlinks to music, spreading general information about the phenomenon, and com- municating thankfulness (sincerely or ironically) about receiving earworms. Sentiment analysis revealed a bal- ance towards negative emotional expressions in com- parison to reference data. This is the first study to show this negative appraisal tendency and to demonstrate the ‘earworm’ phenomenon on a global scale.

	abstract = {Children with specific language impairments (SLIs) show impaired perception and production of language, and also show impairments in perceiving auditory cues to rhythm (amplitude rise time [ART] and sound duration) and in tapping to a rhythmic beat. Here we explore potential links between language development and rhythm perception in 45 children with SLI and 50 age-matched controls. We administered three rhythmic tasks, a musical beat detection task, a tapping-to-music task, and a novel music/speech task, which varied rhythm and pitch cues independently or together in both speech and music. Via low-pass filtering, the music sounded as though it was played from a low-quality radio and the speech sounded as though it was muffled (heard “behind the door”). We report data for all of the SLI children (N = 45, IQ varying), as well as for two independent subgroupings with intact IQ. One subgroup, “Pure SLI”, had intact phonology and reading (N=16), the other, "SLI PPR" (N=15), had impaired phonology and reading. When IQ varied (all SLI children), we found significant group differences in all the rhythmic tasks. For the Pure SLI group, there were rhythmic impairments in the tapping task only. For children with SLI and poor phonology (SLI PPR), group differences were found in all of the filtered speech/music AXB tasks. We conclude that difficulties with rhythmic cues in both speech and music are present in children with SLIs, but that some rhythmic measures are more sensitive than others. The data are interpreted within a ‘prosodic phrasing’ hypothesis, and we discuss the potential utility of rhythmic and musical interventions in remediating speech and language difficulties in children.},

	doi = {10.1024/0301-1526.32.1.54},
	abstract = {The most common method for measuring melodic expectancy is the “probe-tone” design, which relies on a retrospective report of expectancy. Here a direct measure of expectancy is introduced, one that uses a speeded, serial categorization task. An analysis of the reaction time data showed that “Implication-Realization” contour models of melodic expectancy provide a good fit. Further analysis suggests that some assumptions of these contour models may not be valid. The traditional “key profile” model of tonality was not found to contribute significantly to the model. Following Krumhansl’s (1990) argument that tonality is learned from the statistical distribution of scale degrees, a tonality model based on the actual probability of scale degrees did significantly improve the fit of the model. It is proposed that the probe-tone method for measuring key profiles encourages listeners to treat the probe tone as being in phrase-final position. Indeed, the key profile was found to be much more similar to the distribution of phrase-final notes than to the distribution of all melodic notes. A second experiment measured reaction times to notes that subjects expected to be phrase-final. In this experiment the key profile contributed significantly to the fit of the model. It is concluded that the probe-tone design creates a task demand to hear the tone as a phrase-final note, and the key profile reflects a learned sensitivity to the distribution of notes at ends of melodies. The “key profile” produced by the new reaction-time design is apparently related to the general distribution of notes in melodies. The results of this study indicate that the relationship between melodic structure and melodic expectation is more straightforward than has been previously demonstrated. Melodic expectation appears to be related directly to the structure and distribution of events in the music.},

We use our methods to consider a range of approaches in music theory, including function theory, root functionality, and the figured-bass tradition. Using new corpus data as well as eleven datasets from five published works, we argue that our framework produces results consistent both with musical intuition and previous work, primarily by recovering the tonic/subdominant/dominant categorization central to traditional music theory.

	abstract = {Perception of temporal patterns is fundamental to normal hearing, speech, motor control, and music. Certain types of pattern understanding are unique to humans, such as musical rhythm. Although human responses to musical rhythm are universal, there is much we do not understand about how rhythm is processed in the brain. Here, I consider findings from research into basic timing mechanisms and models through to the neuroscience of rhythm and meter. A network of neural areas, including motor regions, is regularly implicated in basic timing as well as processing of musical rhythm. However, fractionating the specific roles of individual areas in this network has remained a challenge. Distinctions in activity patterns appear between "automatic" and "cognitively controlled" timing processes, but the perception of musical rhythm requires features of both automatic and controlled processes. In addition, many experimental manipulations rely on participants directing their attention toward or away from certain stimulus features, and measuring corresponding differences in neural activity. Many temporal features, however, are implicitly processed whether attended to or not, making it difficult to create controlled baseline conditions for experimental comparisons. The variety of stimuli, paradigms, and definitions can further complicate comparisons across domains or methodologies. Despite these challenges, the high level of interest and multitude of methodological approaches from different cognitive domains (including music, language, and motor learning) have yielded new insights and hold promise for future progress.},

This paper describes a manner ofrepresenting melodies through a hierarchical structureof elaboration, derived from concepts common in musictheory (in particular, the concept of reduction foundin the work of Schenker and of Lerdahl \& Jackendoff).The fundamental structure is a planar directed acyclicgraph, each node of which represents a musical note(not necessarily as it is present in the actualmelody) and an elaboration which generates that noteon the basis of two parents. These graph structurescan be converted to trees, aiding processing andcomparison, in two ways. Firstly, any graph can betransformed into a set of binary trees in which eachnode represents an interval between two notes and anelaboration of that interval. Secondly, in the planargraph, the link of a node to one of its parents oftenprovides no useful information and can be disregarded,resulting in a reduction of the graph tending towardsa set of trees. From this arises a new approach to thequestion of melodic segmentation. Examples of melodicfragments represented in this manner demonstrate howthe representation makes explicit similarities betweenfragments which would not be found by an approachusing sequences of features.},

In the subsequent test phase, participants either classified test tunes as obeying a rule (direct test) or rated their liking for the tunes (indirect test). Both the direct and indirect tests were sensitive to knowledge of chunks. However, only the indirect test was sensitive to knowledge of the inversion rule.

Multidimensional scaling and hierarchical clustering techniques applied to judgments of two-chord progressions showed a central core consisting of those chords that play primary harmonic functions in the three keys. Th\& separation of chords unique to the keys and the multiple functions of chords shared by the different keys were simultaneously represented. A regular pattern of asymmetries was also found that suggests a hierarchy among different types of chords. In addition, there was a preference for sequences ending on chords central to the prevailing tonality. Comparison with earlier results on single tones points to differences between melodic and harmonic organization.},

Generic intervals are continuous-valued intervals that are converted to real intervals through quantization. Various kinds of chromatic and diatonic sequences are uniform patterns. Uniform patterns provide a way of precisely and quantitatively comparing different kinds of chromatic patterns to diatonic ones by drawing upon the kind of robust, continuous metrics associated with voice-leading spaces. The possibility of deriving chromatic and diatonic logics from common principles suggests a new perspective on the “integration” problem of nineteenth-century harmony—the question of whether chromaticism represents a radical break or an evolution from conventional tonal harmony. The theory of uniform patterns and generic intervals is applied in analysis of the first movement of Schubert's String Quartet No. 15 and other passages from Schubert and Liszt.},

First, a brief comparison of music and language leads to discussion of design features of music, suggesting a deep connection between the biology of music and language. I then selectively review data on animal "music." Examining sound production in animals, we find examples of repeated convergent evolution or analogy (the evolution of vocal learning of complex songs in birds, whales, and seals). A fascinating but overlooked potential homology to instrumental music is provided by manual percussion in African apes. Such comparative behavioral data, combined with neuroscientific and developmental data, provide an important starting point for any hypothesis about how or why human music evolved. Regarding these functional and phylogenetic questions, I discuss some previously proposed functions of music, including Pinker's "cheesecake" hypothesis; Darwin's and others' sexual selection model; Dunbar's group "grooming" hypothesis; and Trehub's caregiving model. I conclude that only the last hypothesis receives strong support from currently available data. I end with a brief synopsis of Darwin's model of a songlike musical "protolanguage," concluding that Darwin's model is consistent with much of the available evidence concerning the evolution of both music and language. There is a rich future for empirical investigations of the evolution of music, both in investigations of individual differences among humans, and in interspecific investigations of musical abilities in other animals, especially those of our ape cousins, about which we know little.},

We claim that the major distinction is that, while both Connectionist and Classical architectures postulate representational mental states, the latter but not the former are committed to a symbol-level of representation, or to a 'language of thought': i.e., to representational states that have combinatorial syntactic and semantic structure. Several arguments for combinatorial structure in mental representations are then reviewed. These include arguments based on the 'systematicity' of mental representation: i.e., on the fact that cognitive capacities always exhibit certain symmetries, so that the ability to entertain a given thought implies the ability to entertain thoughts with semantically related contents. We claim that such arguments make a powerful case that mind/brain architecture is not Connectionist at the cognitive level. We then consider the possibility that Connectionism may provide an account of the neural (or 'abstract neurological') structures in which Classical cognitive architecture is implemented. We survey a number of the standard arguments that have been offered in favor of Connectionism, and conclude that they are coherent only on this interpretation. ?? 1988.},

For example, simple correlations between mode (major vs. minor) and emotion (happy vs. sad) do not adequately explain the enormous range, subtlety or complexity of musically induced emotions. In this study, we examined the structural features of unconstrained musical improvisations generated by jazz pianists in response to emotional cues. We hypothesized that musicians would not utilize any universal rules to convey emotions, but would instead combine heterogeneous musical elements together in order to depict positive and negative emotions. Our findings demonstrate a lack of simple correspondence between emotions and musical features of spontaneous musical improvisation. While improvisations in response to positive emotional cues were more likely to be in major keys, have faster tempos, faster key press velocities and more staccato notes when compared to negative improvisations, there was a wide distribution for each emotion with components that directly violated these primary associations. The finding that musicians often combine disparate features together in order to convey emotion during improvisation suggests that structural diversity may be an essential feature of the ability of music to express a wide range of emotion.},

A robustly applied theoretic apparatus hones our appreciation of a given corpus, especially one such as film music, for which comparatively little analytical attention has been devoted. Just as true, if less frequently offered as an motivator for analysis, is the way in which the chosen music theoretical system stands to see its underlying assumptions clarified and its practical resources enhanced by such contact. The innate programmaticism and aesthetic immediacy of film music makes it especially suited to enrich a number of theoretical practices. A habit particularly ripe for this exposure is tonal hermeneutics: the process of interpreting music through its harmonic relationships. Interpreting cinema through harmony not only sharpens our understanding of various film music idioms, but considerably refines the critical machinery behind its analysis.{\textbackslash}nThe theoretical approach focused on here is transformation theory, a system devised for analysis of art music (particularly from the 19th Century) but nevertheless eminently suited for film music. By attending to the perceptually salient changes, rather than static objects, of musical discourse, transformation theory avoids some of the bugbears of conventional tonal hermeneutics for film (such as the tyranny of the ``15 second rule'') while remaining exceptionally well-calibrated towards musical structure and detail. By examining a handful of passages from films with chromatically convoluted scores---Raiders of the Lost Ark, King Kong, and A Beautiful Mind---I reveal some of the conceptual assumptions of transformational theory while simultaneously interpreting the scenes and films that these cues occupy. Ultimately, it is the notion of ``transformation'' itself---as a theoretical keystone, an analytical stance, and an immanent quality of music---that is most elucidated through this approach.},

Here we report the synthesis and activity of the beta,beta-difluorophenylalanyl derivative of puromycin, an A-site substrate. The fluorine atoms reduce the pK(a) of the nucleophilic alpha-amino group ({\textless}5.0) such that it is deprotonated at all pHs amenable to ribosomal analysis (pH 5.2-9.5). In the 50S modified fragment assay, this substrate reacts substantially faster than puromycin at neutral or acidic pH. The reaction follows a simplified pH profile that is dependent only upon deprotonation of a titratable group within the ribosomal active site. This feature will simplify characterization of the peptidyl transferase reaction mechanism. On the basis of the reaction efficiency of the doubly fluorinated substrate compared to the unfluorinated derivative, the Bronsted coefficient for the nucleophile is estimated to be substantially smaller than that reported for uncatalyzed aminolysis reactions, which has important mechanistic implications for the peptidyl transferase reaction.},

To use reinforcement learning successfully in situations approaching real-world complexity, however, agents are confronted with a difficult task: they must derive efficient representations of the environment from high-dimensional sensory inputs, and use these to generalize past experience to new situations. Remarkably, humans and other animals seem to solve this problem through a harmonious combination of reinforcement learning and hierarchical sensory pro-cessing systems 4,5 , the former evidenced by a wealth of neural data revealing notable parallels between the phasic signals emitted by dopa-minergic neurons and temporal difference reinforcement learning algorithms 3 . While reinforcement learning agents have achieved some successes in a variety of domains 6–8 , their applicability has previously been limited to domains in which useful features can be handcrafted, or to domains with fully observed, low-dimensional state spaces. Here we use recent advances in training deep neural networks 9–11 to develop a novel artificial agent, termed a deep Q-network, that can learn successful policies directly from high-dimensional sensory inputs using end-to-end reinforcement learning.

Functional and anatomical brain imaging assessments showed that TN completely lacks any functional visual cortex. We report here that, among other retained abilities, he can successfully navigate down the extent of a long corridor in which various barriers were placed. A video recording shows him skillfully avoiding and turning around the blockages. This demonstrates that extra-striate pathways in humans can sustain sophisticated visuo-spatial skills in the absence of perceptual awareness, akin to what has been previously reported in monkeys.

	abstract = {The prevalent view of binocular rivalry holds that it is a competition between the two eyes mediated by reciprocal inhibition among monocular neurons. This view is largely due to the nature of conventional rivalry-inducing stimuli, which are pairs of dissimilar images with coherent patterns within each eye's image. Is it the eye of origin or the coherency of patterns that determines perceptual alternations between coherent percepts in binocular rivalry? We break the coherency of conventional stimuli and replace them by complementary patchworks of intermingled rivalrous images. Can the brain unscramble the pieces of the patchwork arriving from different eyes to obtain coherent percepts? We find that pattern coherency in itself can drive perceptual alternations, and the patchworks are reassembled into coherent forms by most observers. This result is in agreement with recent neurophysiological and psychophysical evidence demonstrating that there is more to binocular rivalry than mere eye competition.},

	abstract = {In monkeys, a number of different neocortical as well as limbic structures have cell populations that respond preferentially to face stimuli. Face selectivity is also differentiated within itself: Cells in the inferior temporal and prefrontal cortex tend to respond to facial identity, others in the upper bank of the superior temporal sulcus to gaze directions, and yet another population in the amygdala to facial expression. The great majority of these cells are sensitive to the entire configuration of a face. Changing the spatial arrangement of the facial features greatly diminishes the neurons’ response. It would appear, then, that an entire neural network for faces exists which contains units highly selective to complex configurations and that respond to different aspects of the object “face.”Given the vital importance of face recognition in primates, this may not come as a surprise. But are faces the only objects represented in this way? Behavioural work in humans suggests that nonface objects may be processed like faces if subjects are required to discriminate between visually similar exemplars and acquire sufficient expertise in doing so. Recent neuroimaging studies in humans indicate that level of categorisation and expertise interact to produce the specialisation for faces in the middle fusiform gyrus. Here we discuss some new evidence in themonkey suggesting that any arbitrary homogeneous class of artificial objects—which the animal has to individually learn, remember, and recognise again and again from among a large number of distractors sharing a number of common features with the target—can induce configurational selectivity in the response of neurons in the visual system. For all of the animals tested, the neurons from which we recorded were located in the anterior inferotemporal cortex. However, as we have only recorded fromthe posterior and anterior ventrolateral temporal lobe, other cells with a similar selectivity for the same objects may also exist in areas of the medial temporal lobe or in the limbic structures of the same “expert” monkeys. It seems that the encoding scheme used for faces may also be employed for other classes with similar properties. Thus, regarding their neural encoding, faces are not “special” but rather the “default special” class in the primate recognition system.},

	abstract = {The relationship between structural processing in music and language has received increasing interest in the past several years, spurred by the influential Shared Syntactic Integration Resource Hypothesis (SSIRH; Patel, Nature Neuroscience, 6, 674-681, 2003). According to this resource-sharing framework, music and language rely on separable syntactic representations but recruit shared cognitive resources to integrate these representations into evolving structures. The SSIRH is supported by findings of interactions between structural manipulations in music and language. However, other recent evidence suggests that such interactions also can arise with nonstructural manipulations, and some recent neuroimaging studies report largely nonoverlapping neural regions involved in processing musical and linguistic structure. These conflicting results raise the question of exactly what shared (and distinct) resources underlie musical and linguistic structural processing. This paper suggests that one shared resource is prefrontal cortical mechanisms of cognitive control, which are recruited to detect and resolve conflict that occurs when expectations are violated and interpretations must be revised. By this account, musical processing involves not just the incremental processing and integration of musical elements as they occur, but also the incremental generation of musical predictions and expectations, which must sometimes be overridden and revised in light of evolving musical input.},

A model is proposed in which the acceptability of a string is based on the most probable combination of natural classes that it instantiates. The model is tested on its ability to predict acceptability ratings of nonce words, and its predictions are compared against those of models that lack features or economise on feature specifications. The proposed model achieves the best balance of performance on attested and un- attested sequences, and is a significant predictor of acceptability even after the other models are factored out. The feature-based model’s predictions do not completely subsume those of simpler models, however. This may indicate mul- tiple levels of evaluation, involving segment-based phonotactic probability and feature-based gradient phonological grammaticality.},

	isbn = {978-0-262-53097-2},
	abstract = {(Preface) This book is organized in the following way. Part I opens with an introductory chapter, Chapter One, in which background assumptions are briefly sketched. In Chapter Two of Part I our major conclusions with respect to phonological theory and the phonology of English are outlined. Also discussed are the possible implications of this work with regard to perceptual processes and the conditions under which knowledge of a language (and, presumably, knowledge of other sorts) can be acquired. Part II of the book is an elaboration of the topics treated in Chapter Two of Part I. Chapters Three and Four examine in considerable detail two aspects of English sound structure which were only sketched in Chapter Two. In the course of this detailed investigation of English sound patterns and their underlying structure, certain rules of English phonology are developed. These rules are restated in Chapter Five, which concludes Part Two. The primary emphasis in Part II is on the phonology of English; theory is developed informally as needed for the exposition and analysis. Part III deals with certain aspects of the historical evolution of the sound patterns revealed in the synchronic study in Part II. Part IV is devoted to phonological theory. The informal discussion in Part I is expanded upon, and the theory presented in an ad hoc manner in Part II is systematically developed. The first chapter of Part IV-Chapter Seven-is concerned with universal phonetics, that is, with the general theory of linguistic representation of speech signals. Chapter Eight deals with the principles of organization of the phonological component of the grammar, that is, with the rules that relate syntactic structures to phonetically represented speech signals. In the ninth and concluding chapter, a proposal is presented for an extension of phonological theory that takes into account the intrinsic content of features. Part IV is not concerned with the structure of English but is intended rather as a contribution to universal grammar. In writing the book we have had two classes of potential readers in mind: first, readers who are concerned only with the general properties of English sound structure, with the consequences of these properties for general linguistic theory, and with the implications of general linguistic theory for other fields; second, readers who are concerned with the detailed development of phonological theory and the theory of English, that is, English grammar. Part I of the book is directed to the first class of readers; Parts II, III, and IV, to the second.},

Differences in the processing of these same nonwords that partially reflected their perceived wordlikeness were also found in a recognition memory task.

A postfamiliarization test compared the infants' responses to words versus part-words (trisyllabic sequences spanning word boundaries). The corpus was constructed so that test words and part-words were matched in frequency, but differed in their transitional probabilities.

In the present experiments we ask whether adult learners are also capable of such computations when the only available patterns occur in non-adjacent elements. In the first experiment, we present streams of speech in which precisely the same kinds of syllable regularities occur as in our previous studies, except that the patterned relations among syllables occur between non-adjacent syllables (with an intervening syllable that is unrelated). Under these circumstances we do not obtain our previous results: learners are quite poor at acquiring regular relations among non-adjacent syllables, even when the patterns are objectively quite simple. In subsequent experiments we show that learners are, in contrast, quite capable of acquiring patterned relations among non-adjacent segments-both non-adjacent consonants (with an intervening vocalic segment that is unrelated) and non-adjacent vowels (with an intervening consonantal segment that is unrelated). Finally, we discuss why human learners display these strong differences in learning differing types of non-adjacent regularities, and we conclude by suggesting that these contrasts in learnability may account for why human languages display non-adjacent regularities of one type much more widely than non-adjacent regularities of the other type. ?? 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Our study explored this issue by examining infants′ listening preferences for unfamiliar words that either observe or violate native language phonetic and phonotactic patterns. American 9-month-olds, but not 6-month-olds, listened significantly longer to words with English, rather than Dutch, sound patterns. Dutch 9-month-olds showed the opposite pattern of preferences. No preferences occurred for low-pass-filtered versions of the words, suggesting that infants were responding to phonetic and phonotactic properties rather than to prosodic ones. However, when words fundamentally differed in their prosodic organization (e.g., English vs Norwegian), even American 6-month-olds listened significantly longer to English words.},

	doi = {10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01762},
	abstract = {Music and language are human cognitive and neural functions that share many structural similarities. Past theories posit a sharing of neural resources between syntax processing in music and language (Patel, 2003), and a dynamic attention network that governs general temporal processing (Large and Jones, 1999). Both make predictions about music and language processing over time. Experiment 1 of this study investigates the relationship between rhythmic expectancy and musical and linguistic syntax in a reading time paradigm. Stimuli (adapted from Slevc et al., 2009) were sentences broken down into segments; each sentence segment was paired with a musical chord and presented at a fixed inter-onset interval. Linguistic syntax violations appeared in a garden-path design. During the critical region of the garden-path sentence, i.e., the particular segment in which the syntactic unexpectedness was processed, expectancy violations for language, music, and rhythm were each independently manipulated: musical expectation was manipulated by presenting out-of-key chords and rhythmic expectancy was manipulated by perturbing the fixed inter-onset interval such that the sentence segments and musical chords appeared either early or late. Reading times were recorded for each sentence segment and compared for linguistic, musical, and rhythmic expectancy. Results showed main effects of rhythmic expectancy and linguistic syntax expectancy on reading time. There was also an effect of rhythm on the interaction between musical and linguistic syntax: effects of violations in musical and linguistic syntax showed significant interaction only during rhythmically expected trials. To test the effects of our experimental design on rhythmic and linguistic expectancies, independently of musical syntax, Experiment 2 used the same experimental paradigm, but the musical factor was eliminated—linguistic stimuli were simply presented silently, and rhythmic expectancy was manipulated at the critical region. Experiment 2 replicated effects of rhythm and language, without an interaction. Together, results suggest that the interaction of music and language syntax processing depends on rhythmic expectancy, and support a merging of theories of music and language syntax processing with dynamic models of attentional entrainment.},

This article reviews research in anthropology, eth- nomusicology, developmental and comparative psychol- ogy, neuropsychology, and neurophysiology that bears on questions concerning the origins and evolution of music. We focus on the hypothesis that music perception is constrained by innate, possibly human- and music- specific principles of organization, as these are candi- dates for evolutionary explanations. We begin by discussing the distinct roles of different fields of inquiry in constraining claims about innateness and adaptation, and then proceed to review the available evidence. Although research on many of these topics is still in its infancy, at present there is converging evidence that a few basic features of music (relative pitch, the importance of the octave, intervals with simple ratios, tonality, and per- haps elementary musical preferences) are determined in part by innate constraints. At present, it is unclear how many of these constraints are uniquely human and spe- cific to music. Many, however, are unlikely to be adapta- tions for music, but rather are probably side effects of more general-purpose mechanisms. We conclude by reiterating the significance of identifying processes that are innate, unique to humans, and specific to music, and highlight several possible directions for future research.},

Brightness and lightness perception involve a number of mechanisms operating at different levels of visual processing. One mechanism is low-level, and processes spatial variations in brightness via multiscale filtering. It serves to achieve lightness constancy with respect to the ambient level of illumination. However, it comes at a cost: errors such as simultaneous brightness contrast. A second, mid-level mechanism aims to achieve lightness constancy with respect to spatially varying illumination such as shading, shadows, highlights and transparency. The cost in this case is an enhancement of errors in brightness judgement.},

As a result, the images we see accord with what the sources of the stimuli have typically turned out to be, rather than with the physical properties of the relevant objects.

Unlike English, Russian makes an obligatory distinction between lighter blues ("goluboy") and darker blues ("siniy"). We investigated whether this linguistic difference leads to differences in color discrimination. We tested English and Russian speakers in a speeded color discrimination task using blue stimuli that spanned the siniy/goluboy border. We found that Russian speakers were faster to discriminate two colors when they fell into different linguistic categories in Russian (one siniy and the other goluboy) than when they were from the same linguistic category (both siniy or both goluboy). Moreover, this category advantage was eliminated by a verbal, but not a spatial, dual task. These effects were stronger for difficult discriminations (i.e., when the colors were perceptually close) than for easy discriminations (i.e., when the colors were further apart). English speakers tested on the identical stimuli did not show a category advantage in any of the conditions. These results demonstrate that (i) categories in language affect performance on simple perceptual color tasks and (ii) the effect of language is online (and can be disrupted by verbal interference).},

In addition, we describe the creation of the corpus, the first publicly available data set to contain both musical excerpts and corresponding computer-readable Schenkerian analyses. Combining this corpus with the probabilistic model gives us the first completely data-driven computational approach to hierarchical music analysis.},

It can take place, however, only under certain musical conditions, including the systematic distinction between consonance and dissonance, a consistent set of relationships between tones of greater and lesser structural weight, and a clear differentiation of harmony from voice-leading. Posttonal music generally fails to meet these conditions and thus thwarts analysis in prolongational terms. To understand the middleground structure of posttonal music, we must employ instead an analytical model based on association, linking together distant tones by virtue of their shared register, timbre, metrical placement, or articulation.

Scientists discover qualitatively new forms of structure in observed data: For instance, Linnaeus recognized the hierarchical organization of biological species, and Mendeleev recognized the periodic structure of the chemical elements. Analogous insights play a pivotal role in cognitive development: Children discover that object category labels can be organized into hierarchies, friendship networks are organized into cliques, and comparative relations (e.g., "bigger than" or "better than") respect a transitive order. Standard algorithms, however, can only learn structures of a single form that must be specified in advance: For instance, algorithms for hierarchical clustering create tree structures, whereas algorithms for dimensionality-reduction create low-dimensional spaces. Here, we present a computational model that learns structures of many different forms and that discovers which form is best for a given dataset. The model makes probabilistic inferences over a space of graph grammars representing trees, linear orders, multidimensional spaces, rings, dominance hierarchies, cliques, and other forms and successfully discovers the underlying structure of a variety of physical, biological, and social domains. Our approach brings structure learning methods closer to human abilities and may lead to a deeper computational understanding of cognitive development.},

It is unclear whether simple local features provide the stability necessary to subserve robust recognition of complex objects. In this article, we search the space of two-lobed differential operators for those that constitute a good representational code under recognition and discrimination criteria. We find that a novel operator, which we call the dissociated dipole, displays useful properties in this regard. We describe simple computational experiments to assess the merits of such dipoles relative to the more traditional local operators. The results suggest that nonlocal operators constitute a vocabulary that is stable across a range of image transformations.},

Previously, we have shown that these receptive field properties may be accounted for in terms of a strategy for producing a sparse distribution of output activity in response to natural images. Here, in addition to describing this work in a more expansive fashion, we examine the neurobiological implications of sparse coding. Of particular interest is the case when the code is overcomplete--i.e., when the number of code elements is greater than the effective dimensionality of the input space. Because the basis functions are non-orthogonal and not linearly independent of each other, sparsifying the code will recruit only those basis functions necessary for representing a given input, and so the input-output function will deviate from being purely linear. These deviations from linearity provide a potential explanation for the weak forms of non-linearity observed in the response properties of cortical simple cells, and they further make predictions about the expected interactions among units in response to naturalistic stimuli.},

	abstract = {My aim in this essay is to raise the question "Is there such a thing as mental illness?" and to argue that there is not. Since the notion of mental illness is extremely widely used nowadays, inquiry into the ways in which this term is employed would seem to be especially indicated. Mental illness, of course, is not literally a "thing" -- or physical object -- and hence it can "exist" only in the same sort of way in which other theoretical concepts exist. Yet, familiar theories are in the habit of posing, sooner or later -- at least to those who come to believe in them -- as "objective truths" (or "facts"). During certain historical periods, explanatory conceptions such as deities, witches, and microorganisms appeared not only as theories but as self-evident causes of a vast number of events. I submit that today mental illness is widely regarded in a somewhat similar fashion, that is, as the cause of innumerable diverse happenings. As an antidote to the complacent use of the notion of mental illness -- whether as a self-evident phenomenon, theory, or cause-- let us ask this question: What is meant when it is asserted that someone is mentally ill? In what follows I shall describe briefly the main uses to which the concept of mental illness has been put. I shall argue that this notion has outlived whatever usefulness it might have had and that it now functions merely as a convenient myth.},

	abstract = {The lack of attention given to Schenkerian theory by empirical research in music is striking when compared to its status in music theory as a standard account of tonality. In this paper I advocate a different way of thinking of Schenkerian theory that can lead to empirically testable claims, and report on an experiment that shows how hypotheses derived from Schenker’s theories explain features of listener’s perception of key relationships. To be relevant to empirical research, Schenker’s theory must be treated as a collection of interrelated but independent theoretical claims rather than a comprehensive analytical method. These discrete theoretical claims can then lead to hypotheses that we can test through empirical methods. This makes it possible for Schenkerian theory improve our scientific understanding of how listeners understand tonal music. At the same time, it opens the possibility of challenging the usefulness of certain aspects of the theory. This paper exemplifies the empirical project with an experiment on the perception of key distance. The results show that two features of Schenkerian theory predict how listeners rate stimuli in terms of key distance. The first is the Schenkerian principle of “composing out” a harmony, and the second is the theory of “voice-leading prolongations.” In a regression analysis, both of these principles significantly improve upon a model of distance ratings based on change of scalar collection alone.},

	abstract = {Numerous generative approaches to explaining tonal structure and/or Schenker’s theories have been proposed since Babbitt noted a resemblance between Schenker’s analytical method and Chomskian generative grammars in 1965. One of the more challenging features of Schenker’s theory to replicate in a generative system is the interaction of counterpoint and hierarchy. Many theorists, such as Lerdahl and Jackendoff, skirt the problem by developing non-contrapuntal systems, meaning ones that do not allow for layers with conflicting hierarchical descriptions. This article tackles the counterpoint problem by first proposing a dynamic model for tonal hierarchy, which matches the usage of basic Schenkerian symbols (slurs and beams), and differs from the representational model used by Lerdahl and Jackendoff and others. I then summarize Schenker’s argument for a contrapuntal theory of tonal structure and show that this implies a relativity of contrapuntal voices to structural level which necessitates a theory of voice-leading transformation. This concept of voice-leading transformation marks a crucial turning point in Schenker’s analytical practice leading directly to his theory of levels, and is fundamental to understanding his late theory. The article also operationalizes the idea of voice-leading transformations within a generative system, and illustrates it with short analyses of themes from Bach’s Partitas and an extended analysis of the Menuetto from Beethoven’s Op. 21 Piano Sonata. In the latter analysis the concept of voice-leading transformation facilitates the discovery of an exceptional feature in the deep middleground of the piece.},

	abstract = {Previous studies of auditory expectation have focused on the expectedness perceived by listeners retrospectively in response to events. In contrast, this research examines predictive uncertainty-a property of listeners' prospective state of expectation prior to the onset of an event. We examine the information-theoretic concept of Shannon entropy as a model of predictive uncertainty in music cognition. This is motivated by the Statistical Learning Hypothesis, which proposes that schematic expectations reflect probabilistic relationships between sensory events learned implicitly through exposure. Using probability estimates from an unsupervised, variable-order Markov model, 12 melodic contexts high in entropy and 12 melodic contexts low in entropy were selected from two musical repertoires differing in structural complexity (simple and complex). Musicians and non-musicians listened to the stimuli and provided explicit judgments of perceived uncertainty (explicit uncertainty). We also examined an indirect measure of uncertainty computed as the entropy of expectedness distributions obtained using a classical probe-tone paradigm where listeners rated the perceived expectedness of the final note in a melodic sequence (inferred uncertainty). Finally, we simulate listeners' perception of expectedness and uncertainty using computational models of auditory expectation. A detailed model comparison indicates which model parameters maximize fit to the data and how they compare to existing models in the literature. The results show that listeners experience greater uncertainty in high-entropy musical contexts than low-entropy contexts. This effect is particularly apparent for inferred uncertainty and is stronger in musicians than non-musicians. Consistent with the Statistical Learning Hypothesis, the results suggest that increased domain-relevant training is associated with an increasingly accurate cognitive model of probabilistic structure in music.},

Such a perspective has important implications for several topics of general interest besides evolutionary origins. For instance, neural overlap is an important premise for the possibility of music training to influence language acquisition and literacy. However, neural over- lap in processing music and speech does not entail sharing neural circuitries. Neural separability betweenmusic and speechmay occur in overlapping brain regions. In this paper, we review the evidence and outline the issues faced in interpreting such neural data, and argue that converging evidence from several methodologies is needed before neural overlap is taken as evidence of sharing.},

To evaluate the validity of this approach, as well as to develop a quantitative benchmark to assess children's language development, I propose a formal analysis that characterizes the statistical profile of grammatical rules. I show that very young children's language is consistent with a productive grammar rather than memorization of specific word combinations from caregivers' speech. Furthermore, I provide a statistically rigorous demonstration that the sign use of Nim Chimpsky, the chimpanzee who was taught American Sign Language, does not show the expected productivity of a rule-based grammar.

The emerging third generation of activity theory takes two interacting activity systems as its minimal unit of analysis, inviting us to focus research efforts on the challenges and possibilities of inter-organizational learning. Activity theory and its concept of expansive learning are examined with the help of four questions: 1. Who are the subjects of learning? 2. Why do they learn? 3. What do they learn? 4. How do they learn? Five central principles of activity theory are presented, namely activity system as unit of analysis, multi-voicedness of activity, historicity of activity, contradictions as driving force of change in activity, and expansive cycles as possible form of transformation in activity. Together the four questions and five principles form a matrix which is used to present a study of expansive learning in a hospital setting in Finland. In conclusion, implications of the framework for our understanding of the increasingly important horizontal dimension of learning are discussed.},

The study of how far associations between music training and cognitive abilities extend, and whether such associations are more likely for some domains of cognition than for others, has theoretical relevance for issues of transfer, modularity, and plasticity. Unlike most other areas of scientific inquiry, there is parallel interest on the part of the public, the media, and educators who want to know if nonmusical intellectual and academic benefits are a welcome by-product of sending children to music lessons. Indeed, some educators and arts advocates justify music training in schools precisely because of these presumed and desired nonmusical associations.},

Recent work suggests that the SOV order may be the default in human language. Why, then, is SVO order so common? We hypothesize that SOV/SVO variation can be explained by language users’ sensitivity to the possibility of noise corrupting the linguistic signal. In particular, the noisy-channel hypothesis predicts a shift from the default SOV order to SVO order for semantically reversible events, for which potential ambiguity arises in SOV order because two plausible agents appear on the same side of the verb. We found support for this prediction in three languages (English, Japanese, and Korean) by using a gesture-production task, which reflects word-order preferences largely independent of native language. Other patterns of crosslinguistic variation (e.g., the prevalence of case marking in SOV languages and its relative absence in SVO languages) also straightforwardly follow from the noisy-channel hypothesis.},

However, this assumption is an oversimplification because noise is present in typical language use (for instance, due to a noisy environment, producer errors, or perceiver errors). A complete theory of human sentence comprehension therefore needs to explain how humans understand language given imperfect input. Indeed, like many cognitive systems, language processing mechanisms may even be "well designed"--in this case for the task of recovering intended meaning from noisy utterances. In particular, comprehension mechanisms may be sensitive to the types of information that an idealized statistical comprehender would be sensitive to. Here, we evaluate four predictions about such a rational (Bayesian) noisy-channel language comprehender in a sentence comprehension task: (i) semantic cues should pull sentence interpretation towards plausible meanings, especially if the wording of the more plausible meaning is close to the observed utterance in terms of the number of edits; (ii) this process should asymmetrically treat insertions and deletions due to the Bayesian "size principle"; such nonliteral interpretation of sentences should (iii) increase with the perceived noise rate of the communicative situation and (iv) decrease if semantically anomalous meanings are more likely to be communicated. These predictions are borne out, strongly suggesting that human language relies on rational statistical inference over a noisy channel.},

In particular, we argue that the P600 indexes error correction and ensues whenever the probability that the received message was corrupted by noise (due to production or perception errors) exceeds the probability that it was produced intentionally and perceived accurately. We report an ERP experiment that shows that semantic violations that can be explained by a plausible noise process elicit a P600 effect. For example, in a sentence like “The storyteller could turn any incident into an amusing antidote”, the intended word (“anecdote”) is recoverable because it is phonologically and orthographically close to antidote, and is thus a likely erroneous substitution.},

In this paper we develop a way to address the first problem by exploiting chord annotations from online chord data- bases. We show how such chord annotations, despite being noisy and lacking exact chord onset times, can be put to use both during the recognition and training stage. We note that the ability to exploit this large untapped resource may enable researchers to also address the second problem: with more training data, one may be able to use more complex models without running the same high risk of overfitting},

The dominant-tonic progression, known as an authentic cadence, is often used as a marker of the end of a harmonic progression and has been considered a basic syntactic structure of major-minor tonal music by several music theorists and music psychologists. We review data from studies in which brain responses to an authentic cadence were compared to those elicited by music-syntactically inappropriate endings. In event-related electric brain potentials (recorded with EEG), the inappropriate endings elicit early right anterior negativity (ERAN), which is maximal around 200 ms after the presentation of an inappropriate chord. The ERAN is reminiscent of early anterior negativities elicited by syntactic incongruities during the perception of language. Magnetoencephalographic (MEG) data suggest that the ERAN is generated in the inferior frontolateral cortex, an area known to be crucially involved in the processing of (linguistic) syntax. Interestingly, the ERAN can be recorded in nonmusicians and in children, indicating that the ability to acquire (implicit) knowledge about musical regularities and to process musical information according to this knowledge is a general ability of the human brain. This ability is probably of great importance for the acquisition of language in infants and children.},

GE representations contrast with ones that are detailed, complete, and accurate with respect to the input. In this article, we review the original argument for GE processing, and we present new evidence that supports the concept: first, local interpretations are computed, which can interfere with global ones; second, new findings based on the recording of event-related potentials show the use of simple heuristics rather than compositional algorithms for constructing sentence meaning; and recent studies show that the comprehension system has mechanisms for handling disfluencies, but they work imperfectly. We argue that the GE approach to language comprehension is similar to the use of fast and frugal heuristics for decision-making, and that future research should explore this connection more thoroughly.},

In this setup, learners have access to a set of primitive functions and learning consists of composing these functions in order to created structured representations of complex concepts. We present an inductive statisti- cal model over these representations that formalizes an optimal Bayesian trade-off between representational complexity and fit to the observed data. This approach is first applied to the case of number-word acquisition, for which statistical learning with a LOT can explain key developmental patterns and resolve philosophically troublesome aspects of previous developmental theories. Second, we show how these same formal tools can be applied to children’s acquisition of quantifiers. The model explains how children may achieve adult competence with quantifiers’ literal meanings and presuppositions, and predicts several of the most-studied errors children make while learning these words. Finally, we model adult patterns of generalization in a massive concept-learning experiment. These results pro- vide evidence for LOT models over other approaches and provide quantitative evaluation of different particular LOTs. Thesis},

Supporting the SSIRH, Slevc, Rosenberg, and Patel (Psychonomic Bulletin \& Review 16(2):374-381, 2009) recently reported data showing enhanced syntactic garden path effects when the sentences were paired with syntactically unexpected chords, whereas the musical manipulation had no reliable effect on the processing of semantic violations. The present experiment replicated Slevc et al.'s (2009) procedure, except that syntactic garden paths were replaced with semantic garden paths. We observed the very same interactive pattern of results. These findings suggest that the element underpinning interactions is the garden path configuration, rather than the implication of an alleged syntactic module. We suggest that a different amount of attentional resources is recruited to process each type of linguistic manipulations, hence modulating the resources left available for the processing of music and, consequently, the effects of musical violations.},

However, the nature of the shared resources has remained ambiguous. They have been argued to be syntax specific and thus due to shared syntactic integration resources. An alternative view regards them as related to general attention and, thus, not specific to syntax. The present experiments evaluated these accounts by investigating the influence of language on music. Participants were asked to provide closure judgements on harmonic sequences in order to assess the appropriateness of sequence endings. At the same time participants read syntactic garden-path sentences. Closure judgements revealed a change in harmonic processing as the result of reading a syntactically challenging word. We found no influence of an arithmetic control manipulation (experiment 1) or semantic garden-path sentences (experiment 2). Our results provide behavioural evidence for a specific influence of linguistic syntax processing on musical harmony judgements. A closer look reveals that the shared resources appear to be needed to hold a harmonic key online in some form of syntactic working memory or unification workspace related to the integration of chords and words. Overall, our results support the syntax specificity of shared music–language processing resources.},

We present a Bayesian model to explain why this reduced discriminability might occur: It arises as a consequence of optimally solving the statistical problem of perception in noise. In the optimal solution to this problem, listeners' perception is biased toward phonetic category means because they use knowledge of these categories to guide their inferences about speakers' target productions. Simulations show that model predictions closely correspond to previously published human data, and novel experimental results provide evidence for the predicted link between perceptual warping and noise.

Existing theories of rhythmic structure are often restricted to music as it is notated in a score, and as a result are bound to refrain from making statements about music as it is perceived and appreciated by listeners. This paper outlines a cognitive approach to the study of rhythm and timing that allows for making scientific observations and statements about ‘sounding’ music, music as it is performed and listened to. This approach was developed over the last few years in the context of the Music, Mind, Machine project at the Nijmegen Institute for Cognition of Information. In addition, the notion of rhythm space (the set of all possible performed rhythms) is elaborated into a systematic method for the investigation of the relation between rhythmic structure, expressive timing and tempo. As such the paper presents a research program that aims to develop a theory of music incorporating both the structural and perceptual aspects of musical time.},

Although these evaluations of intuitive relative judgments are valuable, they do not justify the use of nonquantitative linguistic methods. We argue that objectivity is a universal value in science that should be adopted by linguistics. In addition, the reliability measures that S\&A report are not sufficient for developing sophisticated linguistic theories. Furthermore, quantitative methods yield two additional benefits: consistency of judgments across many pairs of judgments; and an understanding of the relative effect sizes across sets of judgments. We illustrate these points with an experiment that demonstrates five clear levels of acceptability. Finally, we observe that S\&A's experiments—where only two authors evaluated 10 years' worth of journal articles and one standard textbook within a few months—further emphasise one of our critical original points: conducting behavioural experiments is in many respects easy and fast with the advent of online research tools like Amazon's Mechanical Turk.

In contrast, neuroimaging studies targeting the representation of music structure have primarily implicated regions in the inferior frontal cortices. Combining individual-subject fMRI analyses with a scrambling method that manipulated musical structure, we provide evidence of brain regions sensitive to musical structure bilaterally in the temporal lobes, thus reconciling the neuroimaging and patient findings. We further show that these regions are sensitive to the scrambling of both pitch and rhythmic structure but are insensitive to high-level linguistic structure. Our results suggest the existence of brain regions with representations of musical structure that are distinct from high-level linguistic representations and lower-level acoustic representations. These regions provide targets for future research investigating possible neural specialization for music or its associated mental processes.},

Music-syntactically regular and irregular chord functions were presented synchronously with syntactically correct or incorrect words, or with words that had either a high or a low semantic cloze probability. Music-syntactically irregular chords elicited an early right anterior negativity (ERAN). Syntactically incorrect words elicited a left anterior negativity (LAN). The LAN was clearly reduced when words were presented simultaneously with music-syntactically irregular chord functions. Processing of high and low cloze-probability words as indexed by the N400 was not affected by the presentation of irregular chord functions. In a control experiment, the LAN was not affected by physically deviant tones that elicited a mismatch negativity (MMN). Results demonstrate that processing of musical syntax (as reflected in the ERAN) interacts with the processing of linguistic syntax (as reflected in the LAN), and that this interaction is not due to a general effect of deviance-related negativities that precede an LAN. Findings thus indicate a strong overlap of neural resources involved in the processing of syntax in language and music.},

	abstract = {Linguistic processing, especially syntactic processing, is often considered a hallmark of human cognition; thus, the domain specificity or domain generality of syntactic processing has attracted considerable debate. The present experiments address this issue by simultaneously manipulating syntactic processing demands in language and music. Participants performed self-paced reading of garden path sentences, in which structurally unexpected words cause temporary syntactic processing difficulty. A musical chord accompanied each sentence segment, with the resulting sequence forming a coherent chord progression. When structurally unexpected words were paired with harmonically unexpected chords, participants showed substantially enhanced garden path effects. No such interaction was observed when the critical words violated semantic expectancy or when the critical chords violated timbral expectancy. These results support a prediction of the shared syntactic integration resource hypothesis (Patel, 2003), which suggests that music and language draw on a common pool of limited processing resources for integrating incoming elements into syntactic structures.

Science, 274, 1926-1928], there has been a great deal of interest in the question of how statistical regularities in the speech stream might be used by infants to begin to identify individual words. In this work, we use computational modeling to explore the effects of different assumptions the learner might make regarding the nature of words - in particular, how these assumptions affect the kinds of words that are segmented from a corpus of transcribed child-directed speech. We develop several models within a Bayesian ideal observer framework, and use them to examine the consequences of assuming either that words are independent units, or units that help to predict other units. We show through empirical and theoretical results that the assumption of independence causes the learner to undersegment the corpus, with many two- and three-word sequences (e.g. what's that, do you, in the house) misidentified as individual words. In contrast, when the learner assumes that words are predictive, the resulting segmentation is far more accurate. These results indicate that taking context into account is important for a statistical word segmentation strategy to be successful, and raise the possibility that even young infants may be able to exploit more subtle statistical patterns than have usually been considered. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We investigated the temporal psychophysics of key-finding over a wide range of tempi using melodic sequences with strong structural cues, where statistical information about overall key profile was ambiguous. Listeners were able to provide robust judgments within specific limits, at rates as high as 400 beats per minute (bpm; ∼7 Hz) and as low as 30 bpm (0.5 Hz), but not outside those bounds. These boundaries on reliable performance show that the process of key-finding is restricted to timescales that are closely aligned with beat induction and speech processing.},

Music, by contrast, can be defined as a social and cultural construct based on that very musicality. One critical challenge is to delineate the constituent elements of musicality. What biological and cognitive mechanisms are essential for perceiving, appreciating and making music? Progress in understanding the evolution of music cognition depends upon adequate characterization of the constituent mechanisms of musicality and the extent to which they are present in non-human species. We argue for the importance of identifying these mechanisms and delineating their functions and developmental course, as well as suggesting effective means of studying them in human and non-human animals. It is virtually impossible to underpin the evolutionary role of musicality as a whole, but a multicomponent perspective on musicality that emphasizes its constituent capacities, development and neural cognitive specificity is an excellent starting point for a research programme aimed at illuminating the origins and evolution of musical behaviour as an autonomous trait.},

One hundred forty-eight participants listened to 16 music excerpts and rated their emotional responses. As expected, sadness was the most salient emotion experienced in response to sad excerpts. However, other more positive and complex emotions such as nostalgia, peacefulness, and wonder were also evident. Furthermore, two personality traits – Openness to Experience and Empathy – were associated with liking for sad music and with the intensity of emotional responses induced by sad music, suggesting that aesthetic appreciation and empathetic engagement play a role in the enjoyment of sad music.},

Cognitive psychologists have since focused on long-term exposure to the music of one’s culture and short-term sensitivity to statistical regularities. Today evidence is rapidly mounting that oscillatory neurodynamics is an impor- tant source of nonlinear auditory responses. This leads us to reevaluate the significance of frequency relation- ships in the perception of music. Here, we present a dynamical systems analysis of mode-locked neural oscillation that predicts cross-cultural invariances in music perception and cognition.We show that this the- oretical framework combines with short- and long-term learning to explain the perception of Hindustani r¯ agas, not only by encultured Indian listeners but also by Western listeners unfamiliar with the style.

The geometry of the Tonnetz, a function of its set-class structure, emphasizes certain operations within a larger group of transformations based on their common-tone retention proper- ties. After reviewing some features of the traditional two-dimensional (2-D) Tonnetz, we will explore features of a 3-D Tonnetz based on the famil- iar dominant-seventh/Tristan tetrachord [0258]. We will then generalize the 3-D Tonnetz to accommodate relations among members of any tetra- chord class. Lastly, we will investigate the relation of a Tonnetz's geom- etry to the group structure of the transforms relating its elements.},

	abstract = {The cognitive neurosciences are based on the idea that the level of neurons constitutes a privileged level of analysis for the explanation of mental phenomena. This paper brings to mind several arguments to elucidate that this presumption is ill-conceived and unwarranted in light of what is currently understood about the physical principles underlying mental achievements. It then scrutinizes the question why nevertheless such conceptions are currently prevailing in many areas of psychology. The paper argues that neuroreductionist conceptions are rooted in four different aspects of our common-sense conception of mental phenomena and their explanation that are illegitimately transferred to scientific inquiry. These four aspects pertain to the notion of explanation, to conceptions about which mental phenomena are singled out for inquiry, to an inductivist epistemology, and, in the wake of behavioristic conceptions, to a bias favoring investigations of input-output relations at the expense of inquiries into internal principles. To the extent that the cognitive neurosciences methodologically adhere to these tacit assumptions, they are prone to turn into a largely atheoretical and data-driven endeavour while at the same time receiving wide-spread public appreciation of their empirical findings.

Recent experimental research has shown evidence of very rapid effects of referential context in resolving local indeterminacies on-line. However, there has been no consensus regarding the nature of these context effects. The current paper summarizes recent work covering a range of phenomena for which referential contrast has been shown to influence on-line processing, including prenominal and post-nominal modification, focus operators, and intonational focus. The results of the body of work suggest that referential context effects are not limited to situations in which the linguistic form of the utterance directly specifies the point of contact with context. Rather, context effects of a pragmatic, Gricean nature appear to be possible, suggesting the relationship between linguistic form and context in rapid on-line processing can be of a very indirect nature.},

Information density emerges as an important predictor of speakers' preferences during production. As information is defined in terms of probabilities, it follows that production is probability-sensitive, in that speakers' preferences are affected by the contextual probability of syntactic structures.

The paper proposes a simple information-theoretic characterization of processing difficulty as the work incurred by resource reallocation during parallel, incremental, probabilistic disambiguation in sentence comprehension, and demonstrates its equivalence to the theory of Hale [Hale, J. (2001). A probabilistic Earley parser as a psycholinguistic model. In Proceedings of NAACL (Vol. 2, pp. 159-166)], in which the difficulty of a word is proportional to its surprisal (its negative log-probability) in the context within which it appears. This proposal subsumes and clarifies findings that high-constraint contexts can facilitate lexical processing, and connects these findings to well-known models of parallel constraint-based comprehension. In addition, the theory leads to a number of specific predictions about the role of expectation in syntactic comprehension, including the reversal of locality-based difficulty patterns in syntactically constrained contexts, and conditions under which increased ambiguity facilitates processing. The paper examines a range of established results bearing on these predictions, and shows that they are largely consistent with the surprisal theory. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Participants followed spoken instructions containing the scalar quantifier some directing them to interact with one of several referential targets (e.g., Click on the girl who has some of the balloons). Participants fixated on the target compatible with the implicated meaning of some and avoided a competitor compatible with the literal meaning prior to a disambiguating noun. Further, convergence on the target was as fast for some as for the non-scalar quantifiers none and all. These findings indicate that the scalar inference is computed immediately and is not delayed relative to the literal interpretation of some. It is argued that previous demonstrations that scalar inferences increase processing time are not necessarily due to delays in generating the inference itself, but rather arise because integrating the interpretation of the inference with relevant information in the context may require additional time.

We argue that, to deal with this "Now-or-Never" bottleneck, the brain must compress and recode linguistic input as rapidly as possible. This observation has strong implications for the nature of language processing: (i) the language system must "eagerly" recode and compress linguistic input; (ii) as the bottleneck recurs at each new representational level, the language system must build a multi-level linguistic representation; and (iii) it must deploy all available information predictively to ensure that local linguistic ambiguities are dealt with "Right-First-Time;" once the original input is lost, there is no way for the language system to recover. This is "Chunk-and-Pass" processing. Similarly, language learning must also occur in the here-and-now. This implies that language acquisition is learning to process, rather than inducing a grammar. Moreover, this perspective provides a cognitive foundation for grammaticalization and other aspects of language change. Chunk-and-Pass processing also helps explain a variety of core properties of language, including its multi-level representational structure and duality of patterning. This approach promises to create a direct relationship between psycholinguistics and linguistic theory. More generally, we outline a framework within which to integrate often disconnected inquiries into language processing, language acquisition, and language change and evolution.},

This paper presents several methods for sampling from an analytic statistical model, and proposes a new approach that maintains the intra opus pattern repetition within an extant piece.

His emphasis on unifying computer science theory - rather than offering a collection of low-level details - sets the book apart, as do his intuitive explanations. Throughout the book, Sipser - a noted authority on the theory of computation - builds students' knowledge of conceptual tools used in computer science, the aesthetic sense they need to create elegant systems, and the ability to think through problems on their own. INTRODUCTION TO THE THEORY OF COMPUTATION provides a mathematical treatment of computation theory grounded in theorems and proofs. Proofs are presented with a "proof idea" component to reveal the concepts underpinning the formalism. Algorithms are presented using prose instead of pseudocode to focus attention on the algorithms themselves, rather than on specific computational models. Topic coverage, terminology, and order of presentation are traditional for an upper-level course in computer science theory. Users of the Preliminary Edition (now out of print) will be interested to note several new chapters on complexity theory: Chapter 8 on space complexity; Chapter 9 on provable intractability, and Chapter 10 on advanced topics, including approximation algorithms, alternation, interactive proof systems, cryptography, and parallel computing."--Publisher's description.},

Using an experimental design modeled after previous studies that used scrambled versions of a spoken story (Lerner et al., 2011) and a silent movie (Hasson et al., 2008), we investigate whether listeners perceive hierarchical structure in music beyond short ({\textasciitilde}6 s) time windows and whether there is cortical overlap between music and language processing at multiple timescales. Experienced pianists were presented with an extended musical excerpt scrambled at multiple timescales-by measure, phrase, and section-while measuring brain activity with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The reliability of evoked activity, as quantified by inter-subject correlation of the fMRI responses, was measured. We found that response reliability depended systematically on musical structure coherence, revealing a topographically organized hierarchy of processing timescales. Early auditory areas (at the bottom of the hierarchy) responded reliably in all conditions. For brain areas at the top of the hierarchy, the original (unscrambled) excerpt evoked more reliable responses than any of the scrambled excerpts, indicating that these brain areas process long-timescale musical structures, on the order of minutes. The topography of processing timescales was analogous with that reported previously for speech, but the timescale gradients for music and speech overlapped with one another only partially, suggesting that temporally analogous structures-words/measures, sentences/musical phrases, paragraph/sections-are processed separately.},

The theory explains how learners can generalize meaningfully from just one or a few positive examples of a novel word's referents, by making rational inductive inferences that integrate prior knowledge about plausible word meanings with the statistical structure of the observed examples. The theory addresses shortcomings of the two best known approaches to modeling word learning, based on deductive hypothesis elimination and associative learning. Three experiments with adults and children test the Bayesian account's predictions in the context of learning words for object categories at multiple levels of a taxonomic hierarchy. Results provide strong support for the Bayesian account over competing accounts, in terms of both quantitative model fits and the ability to explain important qualitative phenomena. Several extensions of the basic theory are discussed, illustrating the broader potential for Bayesian models of word learning.},

If a child could understand speakers’ utterances, it would be easy to learn the meanings of individual words, and once a child knows what many words mean, it is easy to infer speakers’ intended meanings. To the beginning learner, however, both individual word meanings and speakers’ intentions are unknown. We describe a com- putational model of word learning that solves these two inference problems in parallel, rather than relying exclu- sively on either the inferred meanings of utterances or cross-situational word-meaning associations. We tested our model using annotated corpus data and found that it inferred pairings between words and object concepts with higher precision than comparison models. Moreover, as the result of making probabilistic inferences about speak- ers’ intentions, our model explains a variety of behavioral phenomena described in the word-learning literature. These phenomena include mutual exclusivity, one-trial learning, cross-situational learning, the role of words in object individuation, and the use of inferred intentions to disambiguate reference.},

We report an experiment replicating the results of F\&H in humans but also showing that sub- jects learned the language without exploiting in any way the center-embedded structure. When the pro- cedure was modified to make the processing of this structure mandatory, the subjects no longer showed evidence of learning. We propose a simple interpretation for the difference in performance ob- served in F\&H’s task between humans and tamarins and argue that, beyond the specific drawbacks in- herent in F\&H’s study, researching the source of the inability of nonhuman primates to master language within a framework built around Chomsky’s hierarchy of grammars is a conceptual dead end.},

A toroidal representation of key distances is recovered in which keys are located near their neighbors on the circle of fifths, and both parallel and relative major/minor key pairs are proximal. The map is used to represent dynamic changes in the sense of key as cues to key become more or less clear and modulations occur. Two models, one using tone distributions and the other using tone transitions, are proposed for key-finding. The tone transition model takes both pitch and temporal distance between tones into account. Both models produce results highly comparable to those of musically trained listeners, who performed a probe tone task for ten nine-chord sequences. A distributed mapping of tonality is used to visualize activation patterns that change over time. The location and spread of this activation pattern is similar for experimental results and the key-finding model.},

	abstract = {The field of Music Psychology has grown dramatically in the past 20 years, to emerge from being just a minor topic to one of mainstream interest within the brain sciences. However, until now, there has been no comprehensive reference text in the field. The Oxford Handbook of Music Psychology is a landmark text providing, for the first time ever, a comprehensive overview of the latest developments in this fast-growing area of research. With contributions from over fifty experts in the field, the range and depth of coverage is unequalled. All the chapters combine a solid review of the relevant literature with well-reasoned arguments and robust discussions of the major findings, as well as original insights and suggestions for future work. Written by leading experts, the 52 chapters are divided into 11 sections covering both experimental and theoretical perspectives, each edited by an internationally recognised authority Ten sections each present chapters that focus on specific areas of music psychology: - the origins and functions of music - music perception - responses to music - music and the brain - musical development - learning musical skills - musical performance - composition and improvisation - the role of music in our everyday lives - music therapy and conceptual frameworks In each section, expert authors critically review the literature, highlight current issues, and explore possibilities for the future. The final section examines how in recent years the study of music psychology has broadened to include a range of other scientific disciplines. It considers the way that the research has developed in relation to technological advances, fostering links across the field and providing an overview of the areas where the field needs further development in the future. The Oxford Handbook of Music Psychology will be the essential reference text for students and researchers across psychology and neuroscience.},

	abstract = {Musical behaviours are universal across human populations and, at the same time, highly diverse in their structures, roles and cultural interpretations. Although laboratory studies of isolated listeners and music-makers have yielded important insights into sensorimotor and cognitive skills and their neural underpinnings, they have revealed little about the broader significance of music for individuals, peer groups and communities. This review presents a sampling of musical forms and coordinated musical activity across cultures, with the aim of highlighting key similarities and differences. The focus is on scholarly and everyday ideas about music--what it is and where it originates--as well the antiquity of music and the contribution of musical behaviour to ritual activity, social organization, caregiving and group cohesion. Synchronous arousal, action synchrony and imitative behaviours are among the means by which music facilitates social bonding. The commonalities and differences in musical forms and functions across cultures suggest new directions for ethnomusicology, music cognition and neuroscience, and a pivot away from the predominant scientific focus on instrumental music in the Western European tradition.},

	abstract = {Suppose a learner is faced with a domain of problems about which it knows nearly nothing. It does not know the distribution of problems, the space of solutions is not smooth, and the reward signal is uninformative, providing perhaps a few bits of information but not enough to steer the learner effectively. How can such a learner ever get off the ground? A common intuition is that if the solutions to these problems share a common structure, and the learner can solve some simple problems by brute force, it should be able to extract useful components from these solutions and, by composing them, explore the solution space more efficiently. Here, we formalize this intuition, where the solution space is that of typed functional programs and the gained information is stored as a stochastic grammar over programs. We propose an iterative procedure for exploring such spaces: in the first step of each iteration, the learner explores a finite subset of the domain, guided by a stochastic grammar; in the second step, the learner compresses the successful solutions from the first step to estimate a new stochastic grammar. We test this procedure on symbolic regression and Boolean circuit learning and show that the learner discovers modular concepts for these domains. Whereas the learner is able to solve almost none of the posed problems in the procedure\{{\textbackslash}textquoteright\}s first iteration, it rapidly becomes able to solve a large number by gaining abstract knowledge of the structure of the solution space.},

	abstract = {For humans, learning abstract concepts and learning language go hand in hand: we acquire abstract knowl-edge primarily through linguistic experience, and ac-quiring abstract concepts is a crucial step in learning the meanings of linguistic expressions. Number knowl-edge is a case in point: we largely acquire concepts such as seventy-three through linguistic means, and we can only know what the sentence " seventy-three is more than twice as big as thirty-one " means if we can grasp the meanings of its component number words. How do we begin to solve this problem? One approach is to es-timate the distribution from which sentences are drawn, and, in doing so, infer the latent concepts and relation-ships that best explain those sentences. We present early work on a learning framework called Latent Predicate Networks (LPNs) which learns concepts by inferring the parameters of probabilistic context-sensitive gram-mars over sentences. We show that for a small frag-ment of sentences expressing relationships between En-glish number words, we can use hierarchical Bayesian inference to learn grammars that can answer simple queries about previously unseen relationships within this domain. These generalizations demonstrate LPNs' promise as a tool for learning and representing concep-tual knowledge in language.},

Individuals can differ in their repertoire of musical behaviours as well as in the level of skill they display for any single musical behaviour. The types of musical behaviours we refer to here are broad, ranging from performance on an instrument and listening expertise, to the ability to employ music in functional settings or to communicate about music. In this paper, we first describe the concept of 'musical sophistication' which can be used to describe the multi-faceted nature of musical expertise. Next, we develop a novel measurement instrument, the Goldsmiths Musical Sophistication Index (Gold-MSI) to assess self-reported musical skills and behaviours on multiple dimensions in the general population using a large Internet sample (n = 147,636). Thirdly, we report results from several lab studies, demonstrating that the Gold-MSI possesses good psychometric properties, and that self-reported musical sophistication is associated with performance on two listening tasks. Finally, we identify occupation, occupational status, age, gender, and wealth as the main socio-demographic factors associated with musical sophistication. Results are discussed in terms of theoretical accounts of implicit and statistical music learning and with regard to social conditions of sophisticated musical engagement.},

The present study investigated the effect of a musical chord's tonal function on syntactic processing (Experiment 1) and semantic processing (Experiment 2) using a cross-modal paradigm and controlling for acoustic differences. Participants read sentences and performed a lexical decision task on the last word, which was, syntactically or semantically, expected or unexpected. The simultaneously presented (task-irrelevant) musical sequences ended on either an expected tonic or a less-expected subdominant chord. Experiment 1 revealed interactive effects between music-syntactic and linguistic-syntactic processing. Experiment 2 showed only main effects of both music-syntactic and linguistic-semantic expectations. An additional analysis over the two experiments revealed that linguistic violations interacted with musical violations, though not differently as a function of the type of linguistic violations. The present findings were discussed in light of currently available data on the processing of music as well as of syntax and semantics in language, leading to the hypothesis that resources might be shared for structural integration processes and sequencing.},

Even though it has been shown that specifically chosen musical pieces can prime meaningful concepts, the empirical evidence in favor of such a highly specific semantic pathway has been lacking. Here we show that 2 event-related potentials in response to harmonic expectancy violations, the early right anterior negativity (ERAN) and the N500, could be systematically modulated by simultaneously presented language material containing either a syntactic or a semantic violation. Whereas the ERAN was reduced only when presented concurrently with a syntactic language violation and not with a semantic language violation, this pattern was reversed for the N500. This is the first piece of evidence showing that tension- resolution patterns represent a route to meaning in music.},

Language processing utilized some adjacent left hemispheric IFG and middle temporal regions more than music processing, and music processing also involved right hemisphere regions not activated in language processing.Our data indicate that a dual-stream system with dorsal and ventral long association tracts centered on a functionally and structurally highly differentiated left IFG is pivotal for domain-general syntactic competence over a broad range of elements including words and chords.},

Based on this approach, the article addresses, in detail, the idea of a multi-level approach that ranges from social to neural levels. In physical sciences, a rigorous set of theories is a hierarchy of descriptions/explanations, in which causal relationships among entities at a high level can be reduced to causal relationships among simpler entities at a more detailed level. We argue that a similar hierarchy makes possible an equally productive approach toward cognitive modeling. The levels of models that we conceive in relation to cognition include, at the highest level, sociological/anthropological models of collective human behavior, behavioral models of individual performance, cognitive models involving detailed mechanisms, representations, and processes, as well as biological/physiological models of neural circuits, brain regions, and other detailed biological processes.},

	abstract = {During the last decade, it has been argued that (1) music processing involves syntactic representations similar to those observed in language, and (2) that music and language share similar syntactic-like processes and neural resources. This claim is important for understanding the origin of music and language abilities and, furthermore, it has clinical implications. The Western musical system, however, is rooted in psychoacoustic properties of sound, and this is not the case for linguistic syntax. Accordingly, musical syntax processing could be parsimoniously understood as an emergent property of auditory memory rather than a property of abstract processing similar to linguistic processing. To support this view, we simulated numerous empirical studies that investigated the processing of harmonic structures, using a model based on the accumulation of sensory information in auditory memory. The simulations revealed that most of the musical syntax manipulations used with behavioral and neurophysiological methods as well as with developmental and cross-cultural approaches can be accounted for by the auditory memory model. This led us to question whether current research on musical syntax can really be compared with linguistic processing. Our simulation also raises methodological and theoretical challenges to study musical syntax while disentangling the confounded low-level sensory influences. In order to investigate syntactic abilities in music comparable to language, research should preferentially use musical material with structures that circumvent the tonal effect exerted by psychoacoustic properties of sounds.},

The model makes a nonintuitive prediction: Following a prime chord, expectations for the target chord are based on psychoacoustic similarity at short stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs) but on implicit knowledge of conventional relationships at longer SOAs. In a critical test, 2 targets were selected for each prime. One was more psychoacoustically similar to the prime, and the other was more closely related on the basis of convention. With an SOA of 50 ms, priming favored the psychoacoustically similar target; with SOAs of 500 ms and longer, the effect reversed, and priming favored conventional relatedness. The results underscore the limitations of models of harmony based on psychoacoustic factors alone. These studies demonstrate how neural net learning models that are appropriately constrained can be subject to strong empirical verification.

Here we introduce and apply a novel technique which enables one to isolate ERPs in human elicited by continuous music. The ERPs were recorded during listening to a Tango Nuevo piece, a deep techno track and an acoustic lullaby. Acoustic features related to timbre, harmony, and dynamics of the audio signal were computationally extracted from the musical pieces. Negative deflation occurring around 100 milliseconds after the stimulus onset (N100) and positive deflation occurring around 200 milliseconds after the stimulus onset (P200) ERP responses to peak changes in the acoustic features were distinguishable and were often largest for Tango Nuevo. In addition to large changes in these musical features, long phases of low values that precede a rapid increase - and that we will call Preceding Low-Feature Phases - followed by a rapid increase enhanced the amplitudes of N100 and P200 responses. These ERP responses resembled those to simpler sounds, making it possible to utilize the tradition of ERP research with naturalistic paradigms.},

Eight-chord piano sequences were presented to musically expert and novice listeners.

Participants were not informed that the relevant manipulation was the musical function of the last chord (target) of the sequences. The target chord acted either as a syntactically stable tonic chord (i.e., a C major chord in the key of C major) or as a less syntactically stable subdominant chord (i.e., a C major chord in the key of G major). The critical aspect of the results related to the impact such a manipulation had on the ERPs. An N5-like frontal negative component was found to be larger for subdominant than for tonic chords and attained significance only in musically expert listeners. These findings suggest that the subdominant chord is more difficult to integrate with the previous context than the tonic chord (as indexing by the observed N5) and that the processing of a small change in musical function occurs in an automatic way in musically expert listeners.

Some authors assume that the acquisition of knowledge about these regularities lasts until late childhood, but there is also evidence for the presence of such knowledge in four- and five-year-olds. To explore whether such knowledge is already present in younger children, we tested whether 30-month-olds (N = 62) show neurophysiological responses to music-syntactically irregular harmonies. We observed an early right anterior negativity in response to both irregular in-key and out-of-key chords. The N5, a brain response usually present in older children and adults, was not observed, indicating that processes of harmonic integration (as reflected in the N5) are still in development in this age group. In conclusion, our results indicate that 30-month-olds already have acquired implicit knowledge of complex harmonic music-syntactic regularities and process musical information according to this knowledge. ?? 2014 The Authors.},

A mathematical formulation of the theory describes internal oscillations that focus pulses of attending energy and interact in various ways to enable attentional tracking of events with complex rhythms.

These multimodal effects of music together with music's ability to tap into the emotion and reward system in the brain can be used to facilitate and enhance therapeutic approaches geared toward rehabilitating and restoring neurological dysfunctions and impairments of an acquired or congenital brain disorder. In this article, we review plastic changes in functional networks and structural components of the brain in response to short- and long-term music listening and music making activities. The specific influence of music on the developing brain is emphasized and possible transfer effects on emotional and cognitive processes are discussed. Furthermore, we present data on the potential of using musical tools and activities to support and facilitate neurorehabilitation. We will focus on interventions such as melodic intonation therapy and music-supported motor rehabilitation to showcase the effects of neurologic music therapies and discuss their underlying neural mechanisms.},

Processing of musical syntax activates inferior frontolateral cortex, ventrolateral premotor cortex and presumably the anterior part of the superior temporal gyrus. These brain structures have been implicated in sequencing of complex auditory information, identification of structural relationships, and serial prediction. Processing of musical semantics appears to activate posterior temporal regions. The processes and brain structures involved in the perception of syntax and semantics in music have considerable overlap with those involved in language perception, underlining intimate links between music and language in the human brain. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Music training in childhood is also associated with cognitive, personality, and demographic variables, and it is well established that IQ and personality are determined largely by genetics. Recent evidence also indicates that the role of genetics in music aptitude and music achievement is much larger than previously thought. In short, music training is an ideal model for the study of gene–environment interactions but far less appropriate as a model for the study of plasticity. Children seek out environments, including those with music lessons, that are consistent with their predispositions; such environments exaggerate preexisting individual differences.},

Neuroimpaging studies indicate that music is a powerful stimulus also for the human brain, engaging not jsut the auditory cortex but also a vast, bilateral network of temporal, frontal, parietal, cerebeller, and limbic brain areas that govern auditory perception, syntactic and semantic processing, attention and memory, emotion and mood control, and motor skills. Studies of amusia, a severe form of musical impairment, highlights the right temporal and frontal cortices as the core neural substrates for adequate perception and production of music. Many of the basic auditory and musical skills, such as pitch and timbre perception, start developing already in utero, and babies are born with a natural preference for music and singing. Music has many important roles and functions throughout life, ranging from emotional self-regulation, mood enhancement, and identity formation to promoting the development of verbal, motor, cognitive, and social skills and maintaining their healthy functioning in old age. Music is also used clinically as a part of treatment in many illnesses, which involve affective, attention, memory, communication, or motor deficits. Although more reserach is still needed, current evidence suggests that music-based rehabilitation can be effective in many developmental, psychiatric, and neurological disorders, such as autism, depression, schizophrenia, and stroke, as well as in many chronic somatic illnesses that cause pain and anxiety.},

However, it remains unknown as to how early in development musical experience can have an effect, the nature of any such effects, and whether different types of music experience affect development differently. We found that random assignment to 6 months of active participatory musical experience beginning at 6 months of age accelerates acquisition of culture-specific knowledge of Western tonality in comparison to a similar amount of passive exposure to music. Furthermore, infants assigned to the active musical experience showed superior development of prelinguistic communicative gestures and social behaviour compared to infants assigned to the passive musical experience. These results indicate that (1) infants can engage in meaningful musical training when appropriate pedagogical approaches are used, (2) active musical participation in infancy enhances culture-specific musical acquisition, and (3) active musical participation in infancy impacts social and communication development.},

It is rather a parallel and integrative processing of linguistic and non-linguistic information, involving temporal and frontal areas in particular. This review describes the inherent complexity of auditory speech comprehension from a functional-neuroanatomical perspective. The review is divided into two parts. In the first part, structural and functional asymmetry of language relevant structures will be discus. The second part of the review will discuss recent neuroimaging studies, which coherently demonstrate that speech comprehension processes rely on a hierarchical network involving the temporal, parietal, and frontal lobes. Further, the results support the dual-stream model for speech comprehension, with a dorsal stream for auditory-motor integration, and a ventral stream for extracting meaning but also the processing of sentences and narratives. Specific patterns of functional asymmetry between the left and right hemisphere can also be demonstrated. The review article concludes with a discussion on interactions between the dorsal and ventral streams, particularly the involvement of motor related areas in speech perception processes, and outlines some remaining unresolved issues.

We examined whether expectancy violations in musical harmonic sequences are also perceived as violations of the movement sequences necessary to produce them. Pianists imitated silent videos showing one hand playing chord sequences on a muted keyboard. Results indicate that, despite the absence of auditory feedback, imitation of a chord is fastest when it is congruent with the preceding harmonic context. This suggests that the harmonic rules implied by observed actions induce expectations that influence action execution. As evidence that these predictions are derived at a high representational level, imitation was more accurate for harmonically incongruent chords than for congruent chords executed with unconventional fingering. The magnitude of the effects of context and goal prioritization increased with musical training. Thus, musical training may lead to a domain-general representation of musical grammar, i.e., to a grammar of action. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Music has existed in human societies since prehistory, perhaps because it allows expression and regulation of emotion and evokes pleasure. In this review, we present findings from cognitive neuroscience that bear on the question of how we get from perception of sound patterns to pleasurable responses. First, we identify some of the auditory cortical circuits that are responsible for encoding and storing tonal patterns and discuss evidence that cortical loops between auditory and frontal cortices are important for maintaining musical information in working memory and for the recognition of structural regularities in musical patterns, which then lead to expectancies. Second, we review evidence concerning the mesolimbic striatal system and its involvement in reward, motivation, and pleasure in other domains. Recent data indicate that this dopaminergic system mediates pleasure associated with music; specifically, reward value for music can be coded by activity levels in the nucleus accumbens, whose functional connectivity with auditory and frontal areas increases as a function of increasing musical reward. We propose that pleasure in music arises from interactions between cortical loops that enable predictions and expectancies to emerge from sound patterns and subcortical systems responsible for reward and valuation.},

The present article supplements and extends these earlier reviews by surveying more recent research in what appears to be a burgeoning field. The article comprises four parts, dealing with (1) conventional tapping studies, (2) other forms of moving in synchrony with external rhythms (including dance and nonhuman animals' synchronization abilities), (3) interpersonal synchronization (including musical ensemble performance), and (4) the neuroscience of SMS. It is evident that much new knowledge about SMS has been acquired in the last 7 years.},

	abstract = {Listeners' expectations for melodies and harmonies in tonal music are perhaps the most studied aspect of music cognition. Long debated has been whether faster response times (RTs) to more strongly primed events (in a music theoretic sense) are driven by sensory or cognitive mechanisms, such as repetition of sensory information or activation of cognitive schemata that reflect learned tonal knowledge, respectively. We analyzed over 300 stimuli from 7 priming experiments comprising a broad range of musical material, using a model that transforms raw audio signals through a series of plausible physiological and psychological representations spanning a sensory-cognitive continuum. We show that RTs are modeled, in part, by information in periodicity pitch distributions, chroma vectors, and activations of tonal space--a representation on a toroidal surface of the major/minor key relationships in Western tonal music. We show that in tonal space, melodies are grouped by their tonal rather than timbral properties, whereas the reverse is true for the periodicity pitch representation. While tonal space variables explained more of the variation in RTs than did periodicity pitch variables, suggesting a greater contribution of cognitive influences to tonal expectation, a stepwise selection model contained variables from both representations and successfully explained the pattern of RTs across stimulus categories in 4 of the 7 experiments. The addition of closure--a cognitive representation of a specific syntactic relationship--succeeded in explaining results from all 7 experiments. We conclude that multiple representational stages along a sensory-cognitive continuum combine to shape tonal expectations in music.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.heares.2013.08.011},
	abstract = {A growing body of research suggests that musical training has a beneficial impact on speech processing (e.g., hearing of speech in noise and prosody perception). As this research moves forward two key questions need to be addressed: 1) Can purely instrumental musical training have such effects? 2) If so, how and why would such effects occur? The current paper offers a conceptual framework for understanding such effects based on mechanisms of neural plasticity. The expanded OPERA hypothesis proposes that when music and speech share sensory or cognitive processing mechanisms in the brain, and music places higher demands on these mechanisms than speech does, this sets the stage for musical training to enhance speech processing. When these higher demands are combined with the emotional rewards of music, the frequent repetition that musical training engenders, and the focused attention that it requires, neural plasticity is activated and makes lasting changes in brain structure and function which impact speech processing. Initial data from a new study motivated by the OPERA hypothesis is presented, focusing on the impact of musical training on speech perception in cochlear-implant users. Suggestions for the development of animal models to test OPERA are also presented, to help motivate neurophysiological studies of how auditory training using non-biological sounds can impact the brain's perceptual processing of species-specific vocalizations.

Although this approach has yielded a great deal of knowledge, there are limits to what we can learn about the musical mind from staying within these boundaries. By comparing music processing in humans and other species, we can gain valuable insights into the evolutionary roots of our musical capacities and identify those components of music cognition that are uniquely human. By comparing the processing of music across cultures, we can disentangle universal aspects of music cognition from aspects that are culture-specific. Thus both types of comparative research are needed for a full understanding of the musical mind. The past decade has seen exciting new developments in comparative research that invite further exploration of this frontier area within music psychology.

The graph-theoretic notion of eccentricity suggests that when working in a harmonic scheme dictated by any common musical scale, no triad is any more isolated than any other. Complex network theory refines this idea, and in this context provides measures of how important particular triads might be for the flow of chord progressions through the harmonic network. We review and compare several different such measures of centrality and communicability.},

Using an audience response system developed for this purpose, we measured subjective experience and peripheral psychophysiological changes continuously. To confirm the existence of the link between expectation and emotion, we used a threefold approach. (1) On the basis of an information-theoretic cognitive model, melodic pitch expectations were predicted by analyzing the musical stimuli used (six pieces of solo flute music). (2) A continuous rating scale was used by half of the audience to measure their experience of unexpectedness toward the music heard. (3) Emotional reactions were measured using a multicomponent approach: subjective feeling (valence and arousal rated continuously by the other half of the audience members), expressive behavior (facial EMG), and peripheral arousal (the latter two being measured in all 50 participants). Results confirmed the predicted relationship between high-information-content musical events, the violation of musical expectations (in corresponding ratings), and emotional reactions (psychologically and physiologically). Musical structures leading to expectation reactions were manifested in emotional reactions at different emotion component levels (increases in subjective arousal and autonomic nervous system activations). These results emphasize the role of musical structure in emotion induction, leading to a further understanding of the frequently experienced emotional effects of music.},

Here, we investigated how rhythmical patterns in music are processed in the human brain, and, in addition, evaluated the impact of musical training on rhythm processing. Using fMRI, we found that deviations from a rule-based regular rhythmic structure activated the left planum temporale together with Broca's area and its right-hemispheric homolog across subjects, that is, a network also crucially involved in the processing of harmonic structure in music and the syntactic analysis of language. Comparing the BOLD responses to rhythmic variations between professional jazz drummers and musical laypersons, we found that only highly trained rhythmic experts show additional activity in left-hemispheric supramarginal gyrus, a higher-order region involved in processing of linguistic syntax. This suggests an additional functional recruitment of brain areas usually dedicated to complex linguistic syntax processing for the analysis of rhythmical patterns only in professional jazz drummers, who are especially trained to use rhythmical cues for communication.},

	abstract = {Musical rhythm, consisting of apparently abstract intervals of accented temporal events, has a remarkable capacity to move our minds and bodies. How does the cognitive system enable our experiences of rhythmically complex music? In this paper, we describe some common forms of rhythmic complexity in music and propose the theory of predictive coding (PC) as a framework for understanding how rhythm and rhythmic complexity are processed in the brain. We also consider why we feel so compelled by rhythmic tension in music. First, we consider theories of rhythm and meter perception, which provide hierarchical and computational approaches to modeling. Second, we present the theory of PC, which posits a hierarchical organization of brain responses reflecting fundamental, survival-related mechanisms associated with predicting future events. According to this theory, perception and learning is manifested through the brain's Bayesian minimization of the error between the input to the brain and the brain's prior expectations. Third, we develop a PC model of musical rhythm, in which rhythm perception is conceptualized as an interaction between what is heard ("rhythm") and the brain's anticipatory structuring of music ("meter"). Finally, we review empirical studies of the neural and behavioral effects of syncopation, polyrhythm and groove, and propose how these studies can be seen as special cases of the PC theory. We argue that musical rhythm exploits the brain's general principles of prediction and propose that pleasure and desire for sensorimotor synchronization from musical rhythm may be a result of such mechanisms.},

Here we combine a music-classification scheme with sta- tistical analyses, including phylogenetic comparative methods, to examine a well-sampled global set of 304 music recordings. Our analyses reveal no absolute universals but strong support for many statistical universals that are consistent across all nine geo- graphic regions sampled. These universals include 18 musical fea- tures that are common individually as well as a network of 10 features that are commonly associated with one another. They span not only features related to pitch and rhythm that are often cited as putative universals but also rarely cited domains including per- formance style and social context. These cross-cultural structural reg- ularities of human music may relate to roles in facilitating group coordination and cohesion, as exemplified by the universal tendency to sing, play percussion instruments, and dance to simple, repetitive music in groups. Our findings highlight the need for scientists study- ing music evolution to expand the range of musical cultures and musical features under consideration. The statistical universals we identified represent important candidates for future investigation.},

The harmonic content of four compositions is analyzed using methods suitable to each. “Windows” receives a real- time phenomenological approach with Roman numeral analysis, Schenkerian voice-leading graphs, and a “layered approach” originally developed for bebop harmony. The latter two methods are tried with “Litha,” but the layered approach particularly seems unsuitable, thereby revealing ways in which its harmonic orientation differs from that of the bebop style. A review of general principles of organization for passages of nonfunctional harmony, including linear intervallic patterns, equal divi- sions of tonal space, the transposition operation, Neo-Riemannian operations, and other contextual operations (the latter two as plotted on a Tonnetz) leads to a new view of “Litha” and passages from three other compositions, “Tones for Joan’s Bones,”“Steps,” and “Now He Sings, Now He Sobs.”},

	doi = {10.1073/pnas.1612132113},
	abstract = {The neural processes that underlie your ability to read and under-stand this sentence are unknown. Sentence comprehension occurs very rapidly, and can only be understood at a mechanistic level by discovering the precise sequence of underlying computational and neural events. However, we have no continuous and online neural measure of sentence processing with high spatial and temporal resolution. Here we report just such a measure: intracranial record-ings from the surface of the human brain show that neural activity, indexed by γ-power, increases monotonically over the course of a sentence as people read it. This steady increase in activity is absent when people read and remember nonword-lists, despite the higher cognitive demand entailed, ruling out accounts in terms of generic attention, working memory, and cognitive load. Re-sponse increases are lower for sentence structure without meaning (" Jabberwocky " sentences) and word meaning without sentence structure (word-lists), showing that this effect is not explained by responses to syntax or word meaning alone. Instead, the full effect is found only for sentences, implicating compositional processes of sentence understanding, a striking and unique feature of human language not shared with animal communication systems. This work opens up new avenues for investigating the sequence of neu-ral events that underlie the construction of linguistic meaning. language {\textbar} ECoG {\textbar} compositionality {\textbar} syntax {\textbar} semantics H ow does a sequence of sounds emerging from one person's mouth create a complex meaning in another person's mind? Although we have long known where language is processed in the brain (1–3), we still know almost nothing about how neural circuits extract and represent the meaning of a sentence. A powerful method for addressing this question is intracranial re-cording of neural activity directly from the cortical surface in neurosurgery patients (i.e., electrocorticography or ECoG) (4, 5). Although opportunities for ECoG data collection are rare, de-termined by clinical—not scientific—priorities, they nonetheless offer an unparalleled combination of spatial and temporal reso-lution, and further provide direct measures of actual neural ac-tivity, rather than indirect measures via blood flow (as in PET, fMRI, and near infrared spectroscopy/optical imaging). ECoG data are particularly valuable for the study of uniquely human functions like language, where animal models are inadequate. Here we used ECoG to identify the neural events that occur online as the meaning of a sentence is extracted and represented. Prior intracranial recording studies of language have largely fo-cused on speech perception and production (e.g., refs. 6–11) and word-level processes (e.g., refs. 12–26). However, the most distinc-tive feature of human language is its compositionality: the ability to create and understand complex meanings from novel combinations of words structured into phrases and sentences (27). As a first step toward understanding the neural basis of sentence comprehension, we recorded intracranial responses while participants read sentences and three kinds of control stimuli. In each trial, a string of eight items (words or nonwords) were presented sequentially, enabling us to separately measure the neural response to each item individually; to encourage attention to all stimuli (whether meaningful or not), participants decided at the end of each trial whether a probe word/ nonword appeared in the preceding string. Our four stimulus conditions (materials adapted from ref. 28; ex-amples are shown in the " Sample materials " table below) enabled us to orthogonally vary the presence of word meaning and sentence structure. Word-lists (W) included the same words as the sentences (S)},

The Gold-MSI is based around the multidimensional construct of Musical Sophistication and builds on the idea that musical expertise cannot only be developed through musical training on an instrument but also through active engagement with music in its many facets. The questionnaire was developed with a very large English sample (Müllensiefen et al., 2014) and comprises musical expertise with five factors as well as the general factor Musical Sophistication. The English Gold-MSI questionnaire was translated into German and evaluated with a German sample (N = 641). Using confirmative factor analysis the underlying factor structure was confirmed. Furthermore, the results show high reliabilities of the five sub-factors as well as the general factor Musical Sophistication (Cronbach’s alpha between .72 and .91.). Additionally, relationships between variables of the socio-economic status and the sub-factors of the Gold-MSI of the German sample are investigated using a structural equation model. The statistical model reveals positive relationships between income and professional status on the one hand and musical training, perceptual abilities and emotional engagement with music on the other hand. The inventory is freely available and is designed to contribute to the refined investigation of musical sophistication and expertise in German speaking countries.

Studies have provided conflicting reports regarding the relationship between INMI and cognitive load, such that the effect of a systematic cognitive load increase on INMI occurrence and duration remains unknown. In the present study, 200 participants watched and immediately evaluated two non-dialogue, music-only film trailers. Subsequently, they either closed their eyes for 5 min (Baseline), or engaged in one of three dot tasks (Easy, Medium, and Hard) of varying challenge and attentional demand (low, medium, and high cognitive load, respectively). Finally, they completed a novel “Mind Activity Questionnaire”, which allows for indirect sampling of INMI experiences rather than direct questioning. A second Mind Activity Questionnaire was completed 24 hours later. Overall, a significant negative linear trend was found. At Baseline, 65\% of...},

I suggest that recursion should be understood in light of Darwinian's descent with modification. Descent: that is, based on ingredients of neural circuitry found in ‘non-linguistic’ species; and modification: a reconfiguration that is specific to anatomically modern humans. I argue that the expansion of the parietal region associated with the globularization of the neurocranium in our species contributed to the transformation of the connection between Broca's and Wernicke's region via Geschwind's territory, and enabled the pairing of evolutionary ancient networks that together became capable of constructing and processing not just sequences, but sequences of sequences.},

	abstract = {UNLABELLED Dancing to music involves synchronized movements, which can be at the basic beat level or higher hierarchical metrical levels, as in a march (groups of two basic beats, one-two-one-two …) or waltz (groups of three basic beats, one-two-three-one-two-three …). Our previous human magnetoencephalography studies revealed that the subjective sense of meter influences auditory evoked responses phase locked to the stimulus. Moreover, the timing of metronome clicks was represented in periodic modulation of induced (non-phase locked) β-band (13-30 Hz) oscillation in bilateral auditory and sensorimotor cortices. Here, we further examine whether acoustically accented and subjectively imagined metric processing in march and waltz contexts during listening to isochronous beats were reflected in neuromagnetic β-band activity recorded from young adult musicians. First, we replicated previous findings of beat-related β-power decrease at 200 ms after the beat followed by a predictive increase toward the onset of the next beat. Second, we showed that the β decrease was significantly influenced by the metrical structure, as reflected by differences across beat type for both perception and imagery conditions. Specifically, the β-power decrease associated with imagined downbeats (the count "one") was larger than that for both the upbeat (preceding the count "one") in the march, and for the middle beat in the waltz. Moreover, beamformer source analysis for the whole brain volume revealed that the metric contrasts involved auditory and sensorimotor cortices; frontal, parietal, and inferior temporal lobes; and cerebellum. We suggest that the observed β-band activities reflect a translation of timing information to auditory-motor coordination. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT With magnetoencephalography, we examined β-band oscillatory activities around 20 Hz while participants listened to metronome beats and imagined musical meters such as a march and waltz. We demonstrated that β-band event-related desynchronization in the auditory cortex differentiates between beat positions, specifically between downbeats and the following beat. This is the first demonstration of β-band oscillations related to hierarchical and internalized timing information. Moreover, the meter representation in the β oscillations was widespread across the brain, including sensorimotor and premotor cortices, parietal lobe, and cerebellum. The results extend current understanding of the role of β oscillations in neural processing of predictive timing.},

	abstract = {Recent studies establish that cortical oscillations track naturalistic speech in a remarkably faithful way. Here, we test whether such neural activity, particularly low-frequency ({\textless}8 Hz; delta-theta) oscillations, similarly entrain to music and whether experience modifies such a cortical phenomenon. Music of varying tempi was used to test entrainment at different rates. In three magnetoencephalography experiments, we recorded from nonmusicians, as well as musicians with varying years of experience. Recordings from nonmusicians demonstrate cortical entrainment that tracks musical stimuli over a typical range of tempi, but not at tempi below 1 note per second. Importantly, the observed entrainment correlates with performance on a concurrent pitch-related behavioral task. In contrast, the data from musicians show that entrainment is enhanced by years of musical training, at all presented tempi. This suggests a bidirectional relationship between behavior and cortical entrainment, a phenomenon that has not previously been reported. Additional analyses focus on responses in the beta range (∼15-30 Hz)-often linked to delta activity in the context of temporal predictions. Our findings provide evidence that the role of beta in temporal predictions scales to the complex hierarchical rhythms in natural music and enhances processing of musical content. This study builds on important findings on brainstem plasticity and represents a compelling demonstration that cortical neural entrainment is tightly coupled to both musical training and task performance, further supporting a role for cortical oscillatory activity in music perception and cognition.},

Dynamic attending theory first proposed synchronization of endogenous perceptual rhythms nearly forty years ago, but only recently has the pivotal role of neural synchrony been demonstrated. Significant progress has since been made in understanding the role of neural oscillations and the neural structures that support synchronized responses to musical rhythm. Synchronized neural activity has been observed in auditory and motor networks, and has been linked with attentional allocation and movement coordination. Here we describe a neurodynamic model that shows how self-organization of oscillations in interacting sensory and motor networks could be responsible for the formation of the pulse percept in complex rhythms. We test the model's prediction that pulse can be perceived at a frequency for which no spectral energy is present in the amplitude envelope of the acoustic rhythm. The result provides a theoretical link between oscillatory neurodynamics and the induction of pulse and meter in musical rhythm.},

If a goal of music-making is to promote a euphonious effect, then those sets that exhibit a pleth- ora of consonant intervals and a paucity of dissonant intervals might be of particular interest to musicians. In this paper, it is shown that the pitch-class sets that provide the most consonant interval-class invento- ries are the major diatonic scale, the harmonic and melodic minor scales, and equally tempered equivalents of the Japanese Ritsu mode, the common penta tonic scale, and the common "blues" scale. Conso- nant harmonic intervals are more readily available in these sets than in other possible sets that can be drawn from the 12 equally tempered pitch chromas.},

The ability to represent recursive structures has been hypothesized to increase the efficiency of hierarchical processing. Theoretical work together with recent empirical findings suggests that the ability to represent the self-similar structure of hierarchical recursive stimuli may be supported by internal neural representations that compress raw external information and increase efficiency. In order to explicitly test whether the representation of recursive hierarchies depends on internalized rules we compared the processing of visual hierarchies represented either as recursive or non-recursive, using task-free resting-state fMRI data. We aimed to evaluate the relationship between task-evoked functional networks induced by cognitive representations with the corresponding resting-state architecture. We observed increased connectivity within Default Mode Network (DMN) related brain areas during the representation of recursion, while non-recursive representations yielded increased connectivity within the Fronto-Parietal Control-Network. Our results suggest that human hierarchical information processing using recursion is supported by the DMN. In particular, the representation of recursion seems to constitute an internally-biased mode of information-processing that is mediated by both the core and dorsal-medial subsystems of the DMN. Compressed internal rule representations mediated by the DMN may help humans to represent and process hierarchical structures in complex environments by considerably reducing information processing load.},

Musicians and non-musicians were presented with musical excerpts containing boundaries at three hierarchical levels, including section, phrase and period boundaries. Non-boundary was chosen as a baseline condition. Recordings from musicians showed CPS (closure positive shift) was evoked at all the three boundaries, and their amplitude increased as the hierarchical level became higher, which suggest that musicians could represent music events at different timescales in a hierarchical way. For non-musicians, the CPS was only elicited at the period boundary and undistinguishable negativities were induced at all the three boundaries. The results indicate that a different and less clear way was used by non-musicians in boundary perception. Our findings reveal, for the first time, an ERP correlate of perceiving hierarchical boundaries in music, and show that the phrasing ability could be enhanced by musical expertise.},

	abstract = {The predictive coding model of perception proposes that neuronal responses are modulated by the amount of sensory input that the internal prediction cannot account for (i.e., prediction error). However, there is little consensus on what constitutes nonpredicted stimuli. Conceptually, whereas mispredicted stimuli may induce both prediction error generated by prediction that is not perceived and prediction error generated by sensory input that is not anticipated, unpredicted stimuli involves no top-down, only bottom-up, propagation of information in the system. Here, we examined the possibility that the processing of mispredicted and unpredicted stimuli are dissociable at the neurophysiological level using human electroencephalography. We presented participants with sets of five tones in which the frequency of the fifth tones was predicted, mispredicted, or unpredicted. Participants were required to press a key when they detected a softer fifth tone to maintain their attention. We found that mispredicted and unpredicted stimuli are associated with different amount of cortical activity, probably reflecting differences in prediction error. Moreover, relative to predicted stimuli, the mispredicted prediction error manifested as neuronal enhancement and the unpredicted prediction error manifested as neuronal attenuation on the N1 event-related potential component. These results highlight the importance of differentiating between the two nonpredicted stimuli in theoretical work on predictive coding.},

	abstract = {In this article I explore the relationship between composing and listening. I begin with a problematic story, draw some general conclusions, introduce relevant concepts from Lerdahl and Jackendoff (1983) and related work, propose some cognitive constraints on compositional systems, discuss "pitch space", and explain why serial (or 12-tone) organizations are cognitively opaque. Most of these topics deserve fuller treatment than is given in these pages. My concern here is just to lay out a basic, if wide-ranging, argument. I am not interested in passing judgement on the composers and compositions that are mentioned, particularly not on the remarkable work by Boulez that I use as a representative example. The thrust of my argument is psychological rather than aesthetic. But since aesthetic issues inevitably impinge on the discussion, I treat them briefly at the end. Boulez's Le Marteau sans Maftre (1954) was widely hailed as a masterpiece of post-war serialism. Yet nobody could figure out, much less hear, how the piece was serial. From hints in Boulez (1963), Koblyakov (1977) at last determined that it 9 was indeed serial, though in an idiosyncratic way. In the interim listeners made what sense they could of the piece in ways unrelated to its construction. Nor has Koblyakov's decipherment subsequently changed how the piece is heard. Meanwhile most composers have discarded serialism, with the result that Koblyakov's contribution has caused barely a ripple of professional interest. The serial organization of Le Marteau would appear, 30 years later, to be irrelevant. This story is, or should be, disturbing. There is a huge gap here between compositional system and cognized result. H o w can this be? One might suppose that the impenetrability of Le Marteau's serial organization is due to insufficient exposure. After all, the piece was innovative; listeners must become accustomed to novel stimuli. Such has been the traditional defence of new art in the face of incomprehension. One might refine this view by pointing out that there is little repetition in Le Marteau. The lack of redundancy perhaps overwhelms the listener's processing capacities. Comprehensibility, then, is arguably a consequence both of the degree of conditioning to the materials and},

	abstract = {The processing of notes and chords which are harmonically incongruous with their context has been shown to elicit two distinct late ERP effects. These effects strongly resemble two effects associated with the processing of linguistic incongruities: a P600, resembling a typical response to syntactic incongruities in language, and an N500, evocative of the N400, which is typically elicited in response to semantic incongruities in language. Despite the robustness of these two patterns in the musical incongruity literature, no consensus has yet been reached as to the reasons for the existence of two distinct responses to harmonic incongruities. This study was the first to use behavioural and ERP data to test two possible explanations for the existence of these two patterns: the musicianship of listeners, and the resolved or unresolved nature of the harmonic incongruities. Results showed that harmonically incongruous notes and chords elicited a late positivity similar to the P600 when they were embedded within sequences which started and ended in the same key (harmonically resolved). The notes and chords which indicated that there would be no return to the original key (leaving the piece harmonically unresolved) were associated with a further P600 in musicians, but with a negativity resembling the N500 in non-musicians. We suggest that the late positivity reflects the conscious perception of a specific element as being incongruous with its context and the efforts of musicians to integrate the harmonic incongruity into its local context as a result of their analytic listening style, while the late negativity reflects the detection of the absence of resolution in non-musicians as a result of their holistic listening style.},

	abstract = {The relationship between the neurobiology of speech and music has been investigated for more than a century. There remains no widespread agreement regarding how (or to what extent) music perception utilizes the neural circuitry that is engaged in speech processing, particularly at the cortical level. Prominent models such as Patel’s Shared Syntactic Integration Resource Hypothesis (SSIRH) and Koelsch’s neurocognitive model of music perception suggest a high degree of overlap, particularly in the frontal lobe, but also perhaps more distinct representations in the temporal lobe with hemispheric asymmetries. The present meta-analysis study used activation likelihood estimate analyses to identify the brain regions consistently activated for music as compared to speech across the functional neuroimaging (fMRI and PET) literature. Eighty music and 91 speech neuroimaging studies of healthy adult control subjects were analyzed. Peak activations reported in the music and speech studies were divided into four paradigm categories: passive listening, discrimination tasks, error/anomaly detection tasks and memory-related tasks. We then compared activation likelihood estimates within each category for music versus speech, and each music condition with passive listening. We found that listening to music and to speech preferentially activate distinct temporo-parietal bilateral cortical networks. We also found music and speech to have shared resources in the left pars opercularis but speech-specific resources in the left pars triangularis. The extent to which music recruited speech-activated frontal resources was modulated by task. While there are certainly limitations to meta-analysis techniques particularly regarding sensitivity, this work suggests that the extent of shared resources between speech and music may be task-dependent and highlights the need to consider how task effects may be affecting conclusions regarding the neurobiology of speech and music.},

	abstract = {Music and language are human cognitive and neural functions that share many structural similarities. Past theories posit a sharing of neural resources between syntax processing in music and language (Patel, 2003), and a dynamic attention network that governs general temporal processing (Large \& Jones, 1999). Both make predictions about music and language processing over time. Experiment 1 of this study investigates the relationship between rhythmic expectancy and musical and linguistic syntax in a reading time paradigm. Stimuli (adapted from Slevc et al., 2009) were sentences broken down into segments; each sentence segment was paired with a musical chord and presented at a fixed inter-onset interval. Linguistic syntax violations appeared in a garden-path design. During the critical region of the garden-path sentence, i.e. the particular segment in which the syntactic unexpectedness was processed, expectancy violations for language, music, and rhythm were each independently manipulated: musical expectation was manipulated by presenting out-of-key chords and rhythmic expectancy was manipulated by perturbing the fixed inter-onset interval such that the sentence segments and musical chords appeared either early or late. Reading times were recorded for each sentence segment and compared for linguistic, musical, and rhythmic expectancy. Results showed main effects of rhythmic expectancy and linguistic syntax expectancy on reading time. There was also an effect of rhythm on the interaction between musical and linguistic syntax: effects of violations in musical and linguistic syntax showed significant interaction only during rhythmically expected trials. To test the effects of our experimental design on rhythmic and linguistic expectancies, independently of musical syntax, Experiment 2 used the same experimental paradigm, but the musical factor was eliminated – linguistic stimuli were simply presented silently, and rhythmic expectancy was manipulated at the critical region. Experiment 2 replicated effects of rhythm and language, without an interaction. Together, results suggest that the interaction of music and language syntax processing depends on rhythmic expectancy, and support a merging of theories of music and language syntax processing with dynamic models of attentional entrainment.},

	abstract = {Musical emotions, such as happiness and sadness, have been investigated using instrumental music devoid of linguistic content. However, pop and rock, the most common musical genres, utilize lyrics for conveying emotions. Using participants’ self-selected musical excerpts, we studied their behavior and brain responses to elucidate how lyrics interact with musical emotion processing, as reflected by emotion recognition and activation of limbic areas involved in affective experience. We extracted samples from subjects’ selections of sad and happy pieces and sorted them according to the presence of lyrics. Acoustic feature analysis showed that music with lyrics differed from music without lyrics in spectral centroid, a feature related to perceptual brightness, whereas sad music with lyrics did not diverge from happy music without lyrics, indicating the role of other factors in emotion classification. Behavioral ratings revealed that happy music without lyrics induced stronger positive emotions than happy music with lyrics. We also acquired functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data while subjects performed affective tasks regarding the music. First, using ecological and acoustically variable stimuli, we broadened previous findings about the brain processing of musical emotions and of songs versus instrumental music. Additionally, contrasts between sad music with versus without lyrics recruited the parahippocampal gyrus, the amygdala, the claustrum, the putamen, the precentral gyrus, the medial and inferior frontal gyri (including Broca’s area), and the auditory cortex, while the reverse contrast produced no activations. Happy music without lyrics activated structures of the limbic system and the right pars opercularis of the inferior frontal gyrus, whereas auditory regions alone responded to happy music with lyrics. These findings point to the role of acoustic cues for the experience of happiness in music and to the importance of lyrics for sad musical emotions.},

Here, we investigated emotions induced by music using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with a data-driven approach based on intersubject correlations (ISC). This method allowed us to identify moments in the music that produced similar brain activity (i.e. synchrony) among listeners under relatively natural listening conditions. Continuous ratings of subjective pleasantness and arousal elicited by the music were also obtained for the music outside of the scanner. Our results reveal synchronous activations in left amygdala, left insula and right caudate nucleus that were associated with higher arousal, whereas positive valence ratings correlated with decreases in amygdala and caudate activity. Additional analyses showed that synchronous amygdala responses were driven by energy-related features in the music such as root mean square and dissonance, while synchrony in insula was additionally sensitive to acoustic event density. Intersubject synchrony also occurred in the left nucleus accumbens, a region critically implicated in reward processing. Our study demonstrates the feasibility and usefulness of an approach based on ISC to explore the temporal dynamics of music perception and emotion in naturalistic conditions.},

Using an oddball paradigm, root minor, dissonant and inverted major chords were presented in a context of consonant root major chords. The chords were transposed to several different frequency levels, so that the deviant chords did not include a physically deviant frequency that could result in an MMR without categorization. The results show that the newborn infants were sensitive to both dissonant and minor chords but not to inverted major chords in the context of consonant root major chords. While the dissonant chords elicited a large positive MMR, the minor chords elicited a negative MMR. This indicates that the two categories were processed differently.

Here, based on a predictive coding view, we consider the nature of these sound representations and how they compete with each other. Predictive processing helps to maintain perceptual stability by signalling the continuation of previously established patterns as well as the emergence of new sound sources. It also provides a measure of how well each of the competing representations describes the current acoustic scene.

Using a recently developed method based on electric brain responses, we found that, similarly to adults, newborn infants segregate concurrent streams of sound, allowing them to organize the auditory input according to the existing sound source. The segregation of concurrent sound streams is a crucial step in the path leading to the identification of objects in the environment. Its presence in newborn infants shows that the basic abilities required for the development of conceptual objects are available already at the time of birth.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.tics.2009.09.003},
	abstract = {Predictive processing of information is essential for goal-directed behavior. We offer an account of auditory per-ception suggesting that representations of predictable patterns, or 'regularities', extracted from the incoming sounds serve as auditory perceptual objects. The audi-tory system continuously searches for regularities within the acoustic signal. Primitive regularities may be encoded by neurons adapting their response to specific sounds. Such neurons have been observed in many parts of the auditory system. Representations of the detected regularities produce predictions of upcom-ing sounds as well as alternative solutions for parsing the composite input into coherent sequences potentially emitted by putative sound sources. Accuracy of the predictions can be utilized for selecting the most likely interpretation of the auditory input. Thus in our view, perception generates hypotheses about the causal struc-ture of the world. Prediction underlies adaptive behavior Achieving one's goals in constantly changing environments requires actions directed at future states of the world. For example, when crossing a street, one has to anticipate the location of cars at the moment when one is likely to intersect their trajectories. Predicting future events is essential for everything we do, from taking into account the immediate sensory consequences of our own actions to signing up to a pension plan. The realization that we constantly interact with the future led to recent theoretical proposals for predictive descriptions of cognitive processes and their implementation in the brain in various domains of cognitive neuroscience. These theories are typically informed by concepts from Bayesian inference and consider that the 'purpose' of perception is to generate testable hypotheses about the causal structure of the external world, based both on prior knowledge and the current sensory input [1]. The various theories differ in their emphasis, spanning the range from cognitive, functional approaches [2,3] through approaches focusing on the two-way transfer of information along sensory hierarchies [4] to},

	abstract = {A common approach for determining musical competence is to rely on information about individuals' extent of musical training, but relying on musicianship status fails to identify musically untrained individuals with musical skill, as well as those who, despite extensive musical training, may not be as skilled. To counteract this limitation, we developed a new test battery (Profile of Music Perception Skills; PROMS) that measures perceptual musical skills across multiple domains: tonal (melody, pitch), qualitative (timbre, tuning), temporal (rhythm, rhythm-to-melody, accent, tempo), and dynamic (loudness). The PROMS has satisfactory psychometric properties for the composite score (internal consistency and test-retest r{\textgreater}.85) and fair to good coefficients for the individual subtests (.56 to.85). Convergent validity was established with the relevant dimensions of Gordon's Advanced Measures of Music Audiation and Musical Aptitude Profile (melody, rhythm, tempo), the Musical Ear Test (rhythm), and sample instrumental sounds (timbre). Criterion validity was evidenced by consistently sizeable and significant relationships between test performance and external musical proficiency indicators in all three studies (.38 to.62, p{\textless}.05 to p{\textless}.01). An absence of correlations between test scores and a nonmusical auditory discrimination task supports the battery's discriminant validity (-.05, ns). The interrelationships among the various subtests could be accounted for by two higher order factors, sequential and sensory music processing. A brief version of the full PROMS is introduced as a time-efficient approximation of the full version of the battery.},

	abstract = {This study addresses the perception of Arabic improvised music. The modal musical system (maqam) as well as the model par excellence of instantaneous musical exposition and composition—instrumental improvisation (taqsım)—are presented. The classical Arabic maqam (plural maqamat) is defined in terms of other fundamental interactive elements. The role of modal perception in the mental organization of a taqsım performed on the ud was explored with tasks involving the identification of musical ele- ments, the segmentation of the musical work, and verbal descriptions and performed melodic “reductions” of the segments. Strong differences in identifications and segmentations are found between listeners of European and Arabic cultural origins. Both groups make segmentations on the basis of salient surface features such as pauses and register changes, but Arab lis- teners make segmentations that are defined by subtle modal changes that often go unnoticed by the Europeans. However, not all of the Arab listeners agree on where such changes take place or even sometimes on which maqamat are being played. One major ambiguity in maqam identification in the taqsım studied is discussed in detail. The melodic reductions of seg- ments in a given maq¯am reveal the nature of Arabic modes as involving not just a tuning system, but also essential melodico-rhythmic configurations that are emblematic of the maqam. A music-analytic approach to the deployment of the maqamat within the form of the taqs¯ım that is informed by the perceptual results is developed. This approach involves the factors that lead to implicit recognition of maqamat, including ambiguities in identification, and those that inform the hierarchical organization of the form on the basis of larger-scale movements among maqamat.},

	abstract = {Nostalgia is an emotion that is most commonly associated with personally and socially relevant memories. It is primarily positive in valence and is readily evoked by music. It is also an idiosyncratic experience that varies between individuals based on affective traits. We identified frontal, limbic, paralimbic, and midbrain brain regions in which the strength of the relationship between ratings of nostalgia evoked by music and blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal was predicted by affective personality measures (nostalgia proneness and the sadness scale of the Affective Neuroscience Personality Scales) that are known to modulate the strength of nostalgic experiences. We also identified brain areas including the inferior frontal gyrus, substantia nigra, cerebellum, and insula in which time-varying BOLD activity correlated more strongly with the time-varying tonal structure of nostalgia-evoking music than with music that evoked no or little nostalgia. These findings illustrate one way in which the reward and emotion regulation networks of the brain are recruited during the experiencing of complex emotional experiences triggered by music. These findings also highlight the importance of considering individual differences when examining the neural responses to strong and idiosyncratic emotional experiences. Finally, these findings provide a further demonstration of the use of time-varying stimulus-specific information in the investigation of music-evoked experiences.},

	abstract = {The structure of Western musical pieces is delineated by several kinds of cadence. Half cadences in the main key indicate temporary endings; authentic cadences in the main key indicate definitive endings. Authentic cadences in the dominant key are of cognitive interest, since they mark a definitive ending at a local level but a temporary ending at a global level. This study investigated the local versus global processing of these cadences. Participants were presented with sections of 16-bar minuets displayed on a computer screen in the form of a musical jigsaw puzzle. The sections consisted of either the first or the second half of the minuet (8 bars each). The first section ended with either a half cadence in the main key (all experiments), an authentic cadence in the dominant key (all experiments), or an authentic cadence in the main key (Exp. 4). The second section always ended in an authentic cadence in the main key. Participants were asked either to join the two sections of each minuet in the most coherent order (Exps. 1, 2, 4) or to rate the perceived completion of each section (Exps. 3, 4). Numerous inversion errors were observed when the first section of the minuets ended with an authentic cadence in the dominant key. Completion judgments indicated that these cadences were perceived as marking a definitive ending. Both facts suggest that local processing of harmonic cadences prevails over global processing. This finding concurs with recent studies showing that listeners had great difficulties in perceiving the higher-order organization of musical form.},

Rule-governed number series, with the final number being a correct or incorrect series ending, were visually presented in synchrony with musical sequences, with the final chord functioning as the expected tonic or the less-expected subdominant chord (i.e., tonal function manipulation). Participants were asked to judge the correctness of the final number as quickly and accurately as possible. The results revealed an interaction between the processing of series ending and the processing of the task-irrelevant chords' tonal function, thus suggesting that music and arithmetic processing share cognitive resources. These findings are discussed in terms of general temporal and structural integration resources for linguistic and non-linguistic rule-governed sequences. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V..},

	abstract = {Music is present in every culture, but the degree to which it is shaped by biology remains debated. One widely discussed phenomenon is that some combinations of notes are perceived by Westerners as pleasant, or consonant, whereas others are perceived as unpleasant, or dissonant 1 . The contrast between consonance and dissonance is central to Western music 2,3 , and its origins have fascinated scholars since the ancient Greeks 4–10 . Aesthetic responses to consonance are commonly assumed by scientists to have biological roots 11–14 , and thus to be universally present in humans 15,16 . Ethnomusicologists 17 and composers 8 , in contrast, have argued that consonance is a creation of Western musical culture 6 . The issue has remained unresolved, partly because little is known about the extent of cross-cultural variation in consonance preferences 18 . Here we report experiments with the Tsimane'—a native Amazonian society with minimal exposure to Western culture—and comparison populations in Bolivia and the United States that varied in exposure to Western music. Participants rated the pleasantness of sounds. Despite exhibiting Western-like discrimination abilities and Western-like aesthetic responses to familiar sounds and acoustic roughness, the Tsimane' rated consonant and dissonant chords and vocal harmonies as equally pleasant. By contrast, Bolivian city-and town-dwellers exhibited significant preferences for consonance, albeit to a lesser degree than US residents. The results indicate that consonance preferences can be absent in cultures sufficiently isolated from Western music, and are thus unlikely to reflect innate biases or exposure to harmonic natural sounds. The observed variation in preferences is presumably determined by exposure to musical harmony, suggesting that culture has a dominant role in shaping aesthetic responses to music. We conducted two studies to measure consonance preferences in populations with varying exposure to Western music. In Study 1, we measured preferences for sounds in residents of the United States and compared them to three populations in Bolivia: (1) residents of the capital city (La Paz); (2) residents of a rural town (San Borja); and (3) members of a native society of horticulturalist-foragers (the Tsimane') in a remote village (Santa Maria) in the Amazon rainforest. City-and town-dwellers were fluent in Spanish and generally had tele-visions and radios. By contrast, the Tsimane' were mostly monolingual in their own language, lacked televisions, and had limited access to music via radio 19 . The Tsimane' village lacked electricity and tap water, was inaccessible by road, and could be reached only by canoe (Fig. 1a). Their contact with Western culture was mainly limited to occasional trips to nearby towns. To compare differences between cultures to intra-cultural variation within Westerners, we tested two groups from the United States—one with at least two years of experience playing a musical instrument, and one with at most one year of experience. The Tsimane' were of particular interest because harmony, polyph-ony, and group performances are by all accounts absent from their music. This conclusion was suggested by previous recordings and documentation},

	abstract = {This article re-examines the concept of a ‘schema’ in light of a new body of empirical evidence regarding the culture and cognition of key in the eighteenth century.The schema concept in music, which originated in the work of Leonard B. Meyer, holds that social and historical experience gives rise to knowledge structures that engender a situated psychology of hearing and a context- contingent understanding of music. In previous studies by Meyer and Robert O. Gjerdingen, evidence for the schema concept has been advanced largely by interpreting a musical corpus as a metaphor for experience. That is, arguments for the existence of schemata as mental categories that configure a situated psychology of hearing have been presented primarily in the form of music analysis – historically situated patterns detected in musical scores. For this reason, the schema concept has remained, in Meyer’s and Gjerdingen’s words, a ‘hypothesis’ and ‘assum[ption]’ respectively.{\textbackslash}nThe evidence I advance here derives from a case study on Beethoven’s Eroica Symphony and what I call the le–sol–fi–sol schema. The study was conducted in the spirit of the psychologically orientated, humanistic music theory that char- acterises Meyer’s lifelong research program. By establishing a correlation between real listeners’ responses in the Symphony’s reception history and the details of my own corpus study of music from the long eighteenth century (1720–1840), my Eroica case study brings a novel perspective to the idea that schemata engender a historical mode of listening. The case study bears out several hypotheses that are basic to Meyer’s writings and perpetuated in Gjerdingen’s galant style project: (1) that replicated patternings in eighteenth- century works are commensurate with listeners’ knowledge structures; (2) that these knowledge structures are historically contingent and therefore engender a situated psychology of hearing; (3) that these situated psychologies are affected by style change; and (4) that schemata provide access to historical modes of listening today.},

We present a rhythmic analysis of a corpus of 15 performances of percussion music from Bamako, Mali. In our corpus, the relative frequency of note onsets in a given metrical position does not correspond to patterns of metrical accent, though there is a stable relationship between onset frequency and metrical position. The implications of this non-congruence between simple statistical likelihood and metrical structure for the ways in which meter and metrical accent may be learned and understood are discussed, along with importance of cross-cultural studies for psychological research.},

	abstract = {Music is often used to regulate emotions and mood. Typically, music conveys and induces emotions even when one does not attend to them. Studies on the neural substrates of musical emotions have, however, only examined brain activity when subjects have focused on the emotional content of the music. Here we address with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) the neural processing of happy, sad, and fearful music with a paradigm in which 56 subjects were instructed to either classify the emotions (explicit condition) or pay attention to the number of instruments playing (implicit condition) in 4-sec music clips. In the implicit vs. explicit condition, stimuli activated bilaterally the inferior parietal lobule, premotor cortex, caudate, and ventromedial frontal areas. The cortical dorsomedial prefrontal and occipital areas activated during explicit processing were those previously shown to be associated with the cognitive processing of music and emotion recognition and regulation. Moreover, happiness in music was associated with activity in the bilateral auditory cortex, left parahippocampal gyrus, and supplementary motor area, whereas the negative emotions of sadness and fear corresponded with activation of the left anterior cingulate and middle frontal gyrus and down-regulation of the orbitofrontal cortex. Our study demonstrates for the first time in healthy subjects the neural underpinnings of the implicit processing of brief musical emotions, particularly in frontoparietal, dorsolateral prefrontal, and striatal areas of the brain.},

	abstract = {We investigate neural and behavioral aspects of the interrelation between ‘liking’ and ‘understanding’ when both appraisals are made within one judgment task. Our goal was to explore questions regarding how these appraisals combine, and specifically whether there is an order-effect when both are employed in sequence. To this end, we tested a hypothesis derived from new models in neuroaesthetics, and concerning processing of art, which suggest that perception may involve a natural sequence from first processing for hedonic quality (i.e., liking) followed by processing for understanding. Thus, due to the initial liking assessment's capacity to prime deepened cognitive involvement, a Liking-Understanding order may show key differences in final assessments or brain activation when compared to an Understanding-Liking sequence. Thirty-two participants evaluated a range of paintings, balanced for visual appeal and understandability, in a two-part task in which half evaluated for understanding followed by liking and the other half had question order reversed. Brain activity was recorded via functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS). Results showed no assessment interrelation or order effect in artwork evaluations. However, participants who began with evaluation for liking, and who came to incongruent combinations (i.e., “I like, but I don't understand” or “I don't like, but I understand”), showed significantly higher activation in left medial prefrontal cortex. This area is functionally associated with attention and integration of hedonic/informational elements. Findings provide tentative support for a liking-driven order-effect, as well as for physiological connection between appraisals, which may not appear in behavioral evidence, and suggest need for further consideration of this topic in appraisal research.},

Although it is not possible to demonstrate that Haydn pursues a fixed musical task in any straightforward manner, it is clear that he nevertheless aims at exploiting in various ways the rich potential implied in his expositional material. In particular, Haydn creates in the recapitulation a long-range prolongation of dominant harmony—the problematic sonority with which the exposition begins—by means of an unexpected succession of voice-leading schemata expressing specific intrinsic formal functions.},

	abstract = {The ability to predict upcoming structured events based on long-term knowledge and contextual priors is a fundamental principle of human cognition. Tonal music triggers predictive processes based on structural properties of harmony, i.e., regularities defining the arrangement of chords into well-formed musical sequences. While the neural architecture of structure-based predictions during music perception is well described, little is known about the neural networks for analogous predictions in musical actions and how they relate to auditory perception. To fill this gap, expert pianists were presented with harmonically congruent or incongruent chord progressions, either as musical actions (photos of a hand playing chords) that they were required to watch and imitate without sound, or in an auditory format that they listened to without playing. By combining task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with functional connectivity at rest, we identified distinct sub-regions in right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG) interconnected with parietal and temporal areas for processing action and audio sequences, respectively. We argue that the differential contribution of parietal and temporal areas is tied to motoric and auditory long-term representations of harmonic regularities that dynamically interact with computations in rIFG. Parsing of the structural dependencies in rIFG is co-determined by both stimulus- or task-demands. In line with contemporary models of prefrontal cortex organization and dual stream models of visual-spatial and auditory processing, we show that the processing of musical harmony is a network capacity with dissociated dorsal and ventral motor and auditory circuits, which both provide the infrastructure for predictive mechanisms optimising action and perception performance.},

Most extant music does not use the sound content of the continua of frequency (pitch) and time directly in the creation of musical patterns. Rather, those patterns are formed on the basis of elements drawn from a discretisation of the pitch continuum into "pitch sets" and, in all rhythmic music, from a discretisation of the time continuum into metrically based durations with proportional values. Musical patterns formed of these elements are perceived not as simple collections of unconnected elements, but as perceptual objects with identities of their own, capable of being combined into more complex patterns. Music thus exhibits all essential characteristics of a particulate system, and can be added to language as a so far unrecognized particulate system of the human world. It may even relate tolanguage in the way chemistry relates to genetics, namely as a necessary but not sufficient antecedent.},

Whereas several studies explored implicit learning of features of Western music, very little work has been done with respect to non-Western music, and synthetic predominantly used. The present study investigated implicit learning of modal melodic features in traditional North Indian music in a realistic and ecologically valid way. It employed a cross-grammar design, using melodic materials from two ragas that use the same scale, Toṛī and Multānī. Participants were trained on the ālāp section of either rāga and tested on novel excerpts from joṛ sections of both ragas featuring 5 distinct melodic features and using binary familiarity and 6-point confidence judgments. Three of the five features were melodically distinctive of either rāga, whereas two were only distinctive based on other than mere pitch sequence features (for instance, emphasis). Findings indicated that Western participants in both groups incidentally learned to recognise some, but not all, of the five features above chance level, and that the melodically distinctive features were better recognised than the non-distinctive ones. Confidence ratings suggest that participants’ performance was consistently correlated with confidence, indicating that they became aware of whether they were right in their responses, i.e. they possessed explicit judgment knowledge. Altogether participants began to incidentally acquire familiarity with a musical style from beyond their cultural background during only a very short exposure.},

The diverse forms and functions of human music place obstacles in the way of an evolutionary reconstruction of its origins. In the absence of any obvious homologues of human music among our closest primate relatives, theorizing about its origins, in order to make progress, needs constraints from the nature of music, the capacities it engages, and the contexts in which it occurs. Here we propose and examine five fundamental constraints that bear on theories of how music and some of its features may have originated. First, cultural trans-mission, bringing the formal powers of cultural as contrasted with Darwinian evolution to bear on its contents. Second, generativity, i.e. the fact that music generates infinite pattern diversity by finite means. Third, vocal production learning, without which there can be no human singing. Fourth, entrainment with perfect synchrony, without which there is neither rhythmic ensemble music nor rhythmic dancing to music. And fifth, the universal propensity of humans to gather occasionally to sing and dance together in a group, which suggests a motivational basis endemic to our biology. We end by considering the evolutionary context within which these constraints had to be met in the genesis of human musicality.},

To address these challenges, we measured fMRI responses to 165 natural sounds and inferred canonical response profiles ("components") whose weighted combinations explained voxel responses throughout auditory cortex. This analysis revealed six components, each with interpretable response characteristics despite being unconstrained by prior functional hypotheses. Four components embodied selectivity for particular acoustic features (frequency, spectrotemporal modulation, pitch). Two others exhibited pronounced selectivity for music and speech, respectively, and were not explainable by standard acoustic features. Anatomically, music and speech selectivity concentrated in distinct regions of non-primary auditory cortex. However, music selectivity was weak in raw voxel responses, and its detection required a decomposition method. Voxel decomposition identifies primary dimensions of response variation across natural sounds, revealing distinct cortical pathways for music and speech.},

	abstract = {Syntactic operations in language and music are well established and known to be linked in cognitive and neuroanatomical terms. What remains a matter of debate is whether the notion of syntax also applies to human actions and how those may be linked to syntax in language and music. The present electroencephalography (EEG) study explored syntactic processes during the observation, motor programming, and execution of musical actions. Therefore, expert pianists watched and imitated silent videos of a hand playing 5-chord sequences in which the last chord was syntactically congruent or incongruent with the preceding harmonic context. 2-chord sequences that diluted the syntactic predictability of the last chord (by reducing the harmonic context) served as a control condition. We assumed that behavioural and event-related potential (ERP) effects (i.e., differences between congruent and incongruent trials) that were significantly stronger in the 5-chord compared to the 2-chord sequences are related to syntactic processing. According to this criterion, the present results show an influence of syntactic context on ERPs related to (i) action observation and (ii) the motor programming for action imitation, as well as (iii) participants' execution times and accuracy. In particular, the occurrence of electrophysiological indices of action inhibition and reprogramming when an incongruent chord had to be imitated implies that the pianist's motor system anticipated (and revoked) the congruent chord during action observation. Notably, this well-known anticipatory potential of the motor system seems to be strongly based upon the observer's music-syntactic knowledge, thus suggesting the " embodied" processing of musical syntax. The combined behavioural and electrophysiological data show that the notion of musical syntax not only applies to the auditory modality but transfers - in trained musicians - to a " grammar of musical action" . ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

We find that we can measure reliable upper bounds on word order freedom in head direction and the ordering of certain sisters, but that more general measures of word order freedom are not currently feasible. Second, we present results of our measures in 34 lan- guages and demonstrate a correlation be- tween quantitative word order freedom of subjects and objects and the presence of nominative-accusative case marking.

I then offer an interpretation of the pervasive but somewhat puzzling phenomenon of syncopation in terms of acoustic emphasis on certain offbeat components of the accompanying dance style. The reasons for the historical tendency of many musical styles to divorce themselves from their dance-based roots are also briefly considered. To the extent that musical rhythms only make sense in the context of bodily movement, researchers interested in ecologically valid approaches to music cognition should make a more concerted effort to extend their analyses to dance, particularly if we hope to understand the cognitive constraints underlying rhythmic aspects of music like meter and groove.},

A key finding was that musicians had better auditory, but not visual, statistical learning than non-musicians.

	abstract = {? 2016 ten Cate, Spierings, Hubert and Honing.While humans can easily entrain their behavior with the beat in music, this ability is rare among animals. Yet, comparative studies in non-human species are needed if we want to understand how and why this ability evolved. Entrainment requires two abilities: (1) recognizing the regularity in the auditory stimulus and (2) the ability to adjust the own motor output to the perceived pattern. It has been suggested that beat perception and entrainment are linked to the ability for vocal learning. The presence of some bird species showing beat induction, and also the existence of vocal learning as well as vocal non-learning bird taxa, make them relevant models for comparative research on rhythm perception and its link to vocal learning. Also, some bird vocalizations show strong regularity in rhythmic structure, suggesting that birds might perceive rhythmic structures. In this paper we review the available experimental evidence for the perception of regularity and rhythms by birds, like the ability to distinguish regular from irregular stimuli over tempo transformations and report data from new experiments. While some species show a limited ability to detect regularity, most evidence suggests that birds attend primarily to absolute and not relative timing of patterns and to local features of stimuli. We conclude that, apart from some large parrot species, there is limited evidence for beat and regularity perception among birds and that the link to vocal learning is unclear. We next report the new experiments in which zebra finches and budgerigars (both vocal learners) were first trained to distinguish a regular from an irregular pattern of beats and then tested on various tempo transformations of these stimuli. The results showed that both species reduced the discrimination after tempo transformations. This suggests that, as was found in earlier studies, they attended mainly to local temporal features of the stimuli, and not to their overall regularity. However, some individuals of both species showed an additional sensitivity to the more global pattern if some local features were left unchanged. Altogether our study indicates both between and within species variation, in which birds attend to a mixture of local and to global rhythmic features.},

Numerous studies using computational methods derived from evolutionary biology have been successfully applied to varied subset of linguistic data. One of the major drawback regarding musical studies is the lack of suitable coded musical data that can be analysed using such evolutionary tools. Here we present for the first time an original set of musical data coded in a way that enables construction of trees classically used in evolutionary approaches. Using phylogenetic methods, we test two competing theories on musical evolution: vertical versus horizontal transmission. We show that, contrary to what is currently believed, vertical transmission plays a key role in shaping musical diversity. The signal of vertical transmission is particularly strong for intrinsic musical characters such as metrics, rhythm, and melody. Our findings reveal some of the evolutionary mechanisms at play for explaining musical diversity and open a new field of investigation in musical evolution.},

One hundred and two participants were drawn from a representative sample to minimize self-selection bias. The results suggest that the emotional responses induced by unfamiliar sad music could be characterized in terms of three underlying factors: Relaxing sadness, Moving sadness, and Nervous sadness. Relaxing sadness was characterized by felt and perceived peacefulness and positive valence. Moving sadness captured an intense experience that involved feelings of sadness and being moved. Nervous sadness was associated with felt anxiety, perceived scariness and negative valence. These interpretations were supported by indirect measures of felt emotion. Experiences of Moving sadness were strongly associated with high trait empathy and emotional contagion, but not with other previously suggested traits such as absorption or nostalgia-proneness. Relaxing sadness and Nervous sadness were not significantly predicted by any of the individual difference variables. The findings are interpreted within a theoretical framework of embodied emotions.},

	abstract = {In noun phrase (NP) coordinate constructions (e.g., NP and NP), there is a strong tendency for the syntactic structure of the second conjunct to match that of the first; the second conjunct in such constructions is therefore low in syntactic information. The theory of uniform information density predicts that low-information syntactic constructions will be counterbalanced by high information in other aspects of that part of the sentence, and high-information constructions will be counterbalanced by other low-information components. Three predictions follow: (a) lexical probabilities (measured by N-gram probabilities and head-dependent probabilities) will be lower in second conjuncts than first conjuncts; (b) lexical probabilities will be lower in matching second conjuncts (those whose syntactic expansions match the first conjunct) than nonmatching ones; and (c) syntactic repetition should be especially common for low-frequency NP expansions. Corpus analysis provides support for all three of these predictions.},

	abstract = {Graph grammars originated in the late 60s, motivated by considerations about pattern recognition and compiler construction. Since then, the list of areas which have interacted with the development of graph grammars has grown quite impressively. Besides the aforementioned areas, it includes software specification and development, VLSI layout schemes, database design, modeling of concurrent systems, massively parallel computer architectures, logic programming, computer animation, developmental biology, music composition, visual languages, and many others.The area of graph grammars and graph transformations generalizes formal language theory based on strings and the theory of term rewriting based on trees. As a matter of fact, within the area of graph grammars, graph transformation is considered a fundamental computation paradigm where computation includes specification, programming, and implementation. Over the last three decades, graph grammars have developed at a steady pace into a theoretically attractive and important-for-applications research field.Volume 2 of the indispensable Handbook of Graph Grammars and Computing by Graph Transformations considers applications to functional languages, visual and object-oriented languages, software engineering, mechanical engineering, chemical process engineering, and images. It also presents implemented specification languages and tools, and structuring and modularization concepts for specification languages. The contributions have been written in a tutorial/survey style by the top experts in the corresponding areas. This volume is accompanied by a CD-Rom containing implementations of specification environments based on graphtransformation systems, and tools whose implementation is based on the use of graph transformation systems.},

Experiments on Penn treebank sentences of comparable length show an even higher constituent F1 of 71\% on non-trivial brackets. We compare distributionally induced and actual part-of-speech tags as input data, and examine extensions to the basic model. We discuss errors made by the system, compare the system to previous models, and discuss upper bounds, lower bounds, and stability for this task.},

	abstract = {The mammalian auditory system extracts features from the acoustic environment based on the responses of spatially distributed sets of neurons in the subcortical and cortical auditory structures. The characteristic responses of these neurons (linearly approximated by their spectro-temporal receptive fields, or STRFs) suggest that auditory representations are formed, as early as in the inferior colliculi, on the basis of a time, frequency, rate (temporal modulations) and scale (spectral modulations) analysis of sound. However, how these four dimensions are integrated and processed in subsequent neural networks remains unclear. In this work, we present a new methodology to generate computational insights into the functional organization of such processes. We first propose a systematic framework to explore more than a hundred different computational strategies proposed in the literature to process the output of a generic STRF model. We then evaluate these strategies on their ability to compute perceptual distances between pairs of environmental sounds. Finally, we conduct a meta-analysis of the dataset of all these algorithms' accuracies to examine whether certain combinations of dimensions and certain ways to treat such dimensions are, on the whole, more computationally effective than others. We present an application of this methodology to a dataset of ten environmental sound categories, in which the analysis reveals that (1) models are most effective when they organize STRF data into frequency groupings-which is consistent with the known tonotopic organization of receptive fields in auditory structures -, and that (2) models that treat STRF data as time series are no more effective than models that rely only on summary statistics along time-which corroborates recent experimental evidence on texture discrimination by summary statistics.},

The present study aims at replicating this finding and at further examining the role of the SMG for pitch memory in musicians. Nonmusicians and musicians received cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the left SMG, right SMG, or sham stimulation, while completing a pitch recognition, pitch recall, and visual memory task. Cathodal tDCS over the left SMG led to a significant decrease in performance on both pitch memory tasks in nonmusicians. In musicians, cathodal stimulation over the left SMG had no effect, but stimulation over the right SMG impaired performance on the recognition task only. Furthermore, the results show a more pronounced deterioration effect for longer pitch sequences indicating that the SMG is involved in maintaining higher memory load. No stimulation effect was found in both groups on the visual control task. These findings provide evidence for a causal distinction of the left and right SMG function in musicians and nonmusicians.},

	title = {The {Convergence} of {Mildly} {Context}-{Sensitive} {Grammar} {Formalisms}},
	abstract = {Investigations of classes of grammars that are nontransformational and at the same time highly constrained are of interest both linguistically and mathematically. Context-free grammars (CFG) obviously form such a class. CFGs are not adequate (both weakly and strongly) to characterize some aspects of language structure. Thus how much more power beyond CFG is necessary to describe these phenomena is an important question. Based on certain properties of tree adjoining grammars (TAG) an approximate characterization of class of grammars, mildly context-sensitive grammars (MCSG), has been proposed earlier. In this paper, we have described the relationship between several different grammar formalisms, all of which belong to MCSG. In particular, we have shown that head grammars (HG), combinatory categorial grammars (CCG), and linear indexed grammars (LIG) and TAG are all weakly equivalent. These formalisms are all distinct from each other at least in the following aspects: (a) the formal objects and operations in each formalism, (b) the domain of locality over which dependencies are specified, (c) the degree to which recursion and the domain of dependencies are factored, and (d) the linguistic insights that are captured in the formal objects and operations in each formalism. A deeper understanding of this convergence is obtained by comparing these formalisms at the level of the derivation structures in each formalism. We have described a formalism, the linear context-free rewriting system (LCFR), as a first attempt to capture the closeness of the derivation structures of these formalisms. LCFRs thus make the notion of MCSGs more precise. We have shown that LCFRs are equivalent to muticomponent tree adjoining grammars (MCTAGs), and also briefly discussed some variants of TAGs, lexicalized TAGs, feature structure based TAGs, and TAGs in which local domination and linear precedence are factored TAG(LD/LP).},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a music analysing system called the automatic time-span tree analyser (ATTA). ATTA derives a time-span tree that assigns a hierarchy of \&ldquo;structural importance\&rdquo; to the notes of a piece of music based on the generative theory of tonal music (GTTM). Although the time-span tree has been applied in music summarization and collaborative music creation systems, these systems use time-span trees manually analysed by experts in musicology. Current systems based on GTTM cannot acquire a time-span tree without manual application of most of the rules, since GTTM does not resolve much of the ambiguity involved in the application of the rules. To solve this problem, we propose a novel computational model of GTTM that re-formalizes the rules through a computer implementation. The main advantage of our approach is that we can introduce adjustable parameters, which enables us to assign priorities to the rules. Our analyser automatically acquires time-span trees by configuring the parameters that cover 17 out of 26 GTTM rules for constructing a time-span tree. Experimental results show that after these parameters were tuned, our method could outperform a baseline performance. We hope to distribute the time-span tree analyser as a tool for various musical tasks, such as searching and arranging music.},

Both authors analysed all 100 songs by hand, using conventional Roman numeral symbols. Agreement between the two sets of analyses was over 90 per cent. The analyses were encoded using a recursive notation, similar to a context-free grammar, allowing repeating sections to be encoded succinctly. The aggregate data was then subjected to a variety of statistical analyses. We examined the frequency of different chords and chord transitions. The results showed that IV is the most common chord after I and is especially common preceding the tonic.

Using a major/minor decision task in Experiment 1, we found that major targets were identified faster, and with fewer errors, when they were related than when unrelated. An apparent absence (and possible reversal) of this effect for minor targets can be attributed to the prime's biasing effect on the target's stability. In Experiments 2 and 3 we tested this hypothesis by employing an in-tune/out-of-tune decision for major and minor targets separately. Both major and minor in-tune targets were identified faster when related than when unrelated. We outline a spreading activation model which consists of a network of harmonic relations.

Newborns prefer their mother's voice over other voices [4-8] and perceive the emotional content of messages conveyed via intonation contours in maternal speech ("motherese") [9]. Their perceptual preference for the surrounding language [10-12] and their ability to distinguish between prosodically different languages [13-15] and pitch changes [16] are based on prosodic information, primarily melody. Adult-like processing of pitch intervals allows newborns to appreciate musical melodies and emotional and linguistic prosody [17]. Although prenatal exposure to native-language prosody influences newborns' perception, the surrounding language affects sound production apparently much later [18]. Here, we analyzed the crying patterns of 30 French and 30 German newborns with respect to their melody and intensity contours. The French group preferentially produced cries with a rising melody contour, whereas the German group preferentially produced falling contours. The data show an influence of the surrounding speech prosody on newborns' cry melody, possibly via vocal learning based on biological predispositions. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {A recently emerging view in music cognition holds that music is not only social and participatory in its production, but also in its perception, i.e. that music is in fact perceived as the sonic trace of social relations between a group of real or virtual agents. While this view appears compatible with a number of intriguing music cognitive phenomena, such as the links between beat entrainment and prosocial behaviour or between strong musical emotions and empathy, direct evidence is lacking that listeners are at all able to use the acoustic features of a musical interaction to infer the affiliatory or controlling nature of an underlying social intention. We created a novel experimental situation in which we asked expert music improvisers to communicate 5 types of non-musical social intentions, such as being domineering, disdainful or conciliatory, to one another solely using musical interaction. Using a combination of decoding studies, computational and psychoacoustical analyses, we show that both musically-trained and non musically-trained listeners can recognize relational intentions encoded in music, and that this social cognitive ability relies, to a sizeable extent, on the information processing of acoustic cues of temporal and harmonic coordination that are not present in any one of the musicians’ channels, but emerge from the dynamics of their interaction. By manipulating these cues in two-channel audio recordings and testing their impact on the social judgements of non-musician observers, we finally establish a causal relationship between the affiliation dimension of social behaviour and musical harmonic coordination on the one hand, and between the control dimension and musical temporal coordination on the other hand. These results provide novel mechanistic insights not only into the social cognition of musical interactions, but also into that of non-verbal interactions as a whole.},

The results of these two groups were compared to previously collected data (N = 60), where participants listened to either the same, sad-sounding piece of music without a description, or to neutral-sounding music. The induced emotions were measured as objectively as possible using indirect memory and judgment tasks. The results suggest that contextual information about a musical piece may indeed influence the emotional effects of that piece, as the sad narrative description appeared to intensify the sadness induced by the sad-sounding piece. The narrative descriptions may have enhanced emotion induction via the visual imagery mechanism (suggested by Juslin \& Västfjäll, 2008), as 80\% of participants in both groups reported thinking about imagery related to the narrative descriptions provided.

Sensory factors constrain preferences for musical intervals, but learning also plays a crucial role. Music illustrates the potential for harmonic and melodic intervals to interact. The capacity to extract changes in pitch direction may be a general property of the auditory system that underlies the perception of both music and speech intonation; whether interval perception is a music-specific skill remains unclear. Our perceptions of the size of pitch intervals are susceptible to a range of extraneous influences such as timbre, pitch register, direction of pitch change, tonal context, and visual signals arising from performers. Knowledge of scales permits precise distinctions between interval sizes. Because scale development depends on instrument timbres, there is no one ideal scale or tuning system. However, most scales throughout history and across cultures are predictable from the harmonic series, reflecting the prevalence of harmonic spectra in musical instruments, including the human voice.

	abstract = {This study examines a group of synaesthetes who report colour sensations in response to music and other sounds. Experiment 1 shows that synaesthetes choose more precise colours and are more internally consistent in their choice of colours given a set of sounds of varying pitch, timbre and composition (single notes or dyads) relative to a group of controls. In spite of this difference, both controls and synaesthetes appear to use the same heuristics for matching between auditory and visual domains (e.g., pitch to lightness). We take this as evidence that synaesthesia may recruit some of the mechanisms used in normal cross-modal perception. Experiment 2 establishes that synaesthetic colours are automatically elicited insofar as they give rise to cross-modal Stroop interference. Experiment 3 uses a variant of the cross-modal Posner paradigm in which detection of a lateralised target is enhanced when combined with a non-informative but synaesthetically congruent sound-colour pairing. This suggests that synaesthesia uses the same (or an analogous) mechanism of exogenous cross-modal orienting as normal perception. Overall, the results support the conclusion that this form of synaesthesia recruits some of the same mechanisms used in normal cross-modal perception rather than using direct, privileged pathways between unimodal auditory and unimodal visual areas that are absent in most other adults.},

When subjects rated how visual lightnesses and auditory pitches "fit together," lighter stimuli fit better with higher pitches, and darker stimuli fit better with lower pitches. These patterns were stronger against black than against white visual backgrounds; however, effects of visual background were eliminated when subjects had a large set of lightness levels from which to choose the visual lightness level that best fit a given auditory pitch or melodic interval. When subjects chose which visual lightness best fit or matched a melodic interval, lighter stimuli were chosen for ascending melodic intervals, and darker stimuli were chosen for descending melodic intervals. Larger melodic intervals produced more extreme (lighter or darker) choices. Auditory pitch exhibits meaningful synesthesia-like mappings with visual lightness when unidimensionally varied in frequency and when multidimensionally varied in interval size and direction.},

If this account is correct, the same set of cross-sensory correspondences (e.g., smallness with brightness, brightness with high pitch, high pitch with sharpness) should emerge regardless of the sensory channel (visual, auditory, or tactile) that is probed. To test this prediction, participants rated a range of visual, auditory, and tactile stimuli on a series of rating scales relating to different dimensions of connotative meaning. The same set of cross-sensory correspondences emerged from all types of stimulus variation. This supports the suggestion that cross-sensory correspondences can reflect reciprocal interactions between dimensions of connotative meaning, and indicates that Spence’s (2011) theoretical framework might be usefully extended to include semantically-based correspondences.},

He first reported that lesions to the caudal part of the inferior frontal gyrus were associated with expressive deficits. Although most of his claims are still true today, the emergence of novel techniques as well as the use of comparative analyses prompts modern research for a revision of the role played by Broca's area. Here we review current research showing that the inferior frontal gyrus and the ventral premotor cortex are activated for tasks other than language production. Specifically, a growing number of studies report the involvement of these two regions in language comprehension, action execution and observation, and music execution and listening. Recently, the critical involvement of the same areas in representing abstract hierarchical structures has also been demonstrated. Indeed, language, action, and music share a common syntactic-like structure. We propose that these areas are tuned to detect and represent complex hierarchical dependencies, regardless of modality and use. We speculate that this capacity evolved from motor and premotor functions associated with action execution and understanding, such as those characterizing the mirror-neuron system.},

There were strong correlations (0.89 {\textless} r {\textless} 0.99) between the emotional associations of the music and those of the colors chosen to go with the music, supporting an emotional mediation hypothesis in both cultures.

Musicians performed better than nonmusicians in recognizing familiar musical phrases and classifying terminal notes. The differences found as a function of expertise were larger for unfamiliar than for familiar melodies. The ERPs to the end notes differed both in terms of amplitude and latency between musicians and nonmusicians, and as a function of participants' familiarity with the melodies and type of violation. Results show that expertise influences the decisional rather than the purely perceptual aspects of music processing and that ERPs can provide important insight into the study of music perception.

	abstract = {This review scrutinizes several findings on human hierarchical processing within the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in diverse cognitive domains. Converging evidence from previous studies has shown that the PFC, specifically, BA44, may function as the essential region for hierarchical processing across the domains. In language fMRI studies, BA 44 was significantly activated for the hierarchical processing of center-embedded sentences and this pattern of activations was also observed in artificial grammar. The same pattern was observed in the visuo-spatial domain where BA44 was actively involved in the processing of hierarchy for the visual symbol. Musical syntax, which is the rule-based arrangement of musical sets, has also been construed as hierarchical processing as in the language domain such that the activation in BA44 was observed in a chord sequence paradigm. P600 ERP was also engendered during the processing of musical hierarchy. Along with a longstanding idea that a human's number faculty is developed as a "by-product of language faculty", BA44 was closely involved in hierarchical processing in mental arithmetic. This review extended its discussion of hierarchical "processing" to hierarchical "behavior", that is, human action which has been referred to as being hierarchically composed. Several lesion and TMS studies supported the involvement of BA44 for hierarchical processing in the action domain. Lastly, the hierarchical organization of cognitive controls was discussed within the PFC, forming a cascade of top-down hierarchical processes operating along a posterior-to-anterior axis of the lateral PFC including BA44 within the network. It is proposed that PFC is actively involved in different forms of hierarchical processing and specifically BA44 may play an integral role in the process. Taking levels of proficiency and subcortical areas into consideration may provide further insight into the functional role of BA44 for hierarchical processing.},

	abstract = {Although recursion has been hypothesized to be a necessary capacity for the evolution of language, the multiplicity of definitions being used has undermined the broader interpretation of empirical results. I propose that only a definition focused on representational abilities allows the prediction of specific behavioural traits that enable us to distinguish recursion from non-recursive iteration and from hier-archical embedding: only subjects able to represent recursion, i.e. to represent different hierarchical dependencies (related by parenthood) with the same set of rules, are able to generalize and pro-duce new levels of embedding beyond those specified a priori (in the algorithm or in the input). The ability to use such representations may be advantageous in several domains: action sequencing, problem-solving, spatial navigation, social navigation and for the emergence of conventionalized com-munication systems. The ability to represent contiguous hierarchical levels with the same rules may lead subjects to expect unknown levels and constituents to behave similarly, and this prior knowledge may bias learning positively. Finally, a new paradigm to test for recursion is presented. Preliminary results suggest that the ability to represent recursion in the spatial domain recruits both visual and verbal resources. Implications regarding language evolution are discussed.},

Once the template is chosen and covered with patterns, two-voice counterpoint in a florid style is generated using a first-order Markov model with constraints obtained from the template. For constructing the model, vertical slices of pitch and rhythm are compiled from a corpus of Pale-strina masses. The template enforces different restrictions that filter the possible paths through the generation pro-cess.

Edelman brings together ideas concerning the selective adaptability of the brain and the interplay of neural impulses during perception to show how the brain creates interconnected neural maps from which memory, the foundation for consciousness, is constructed. Such maps are adaptive; they can change in response to a plethora of ongoing associations in the cortex. Hence, perceptions, rather than remaining fixed in memory, are acts of reconstruction, a perspective that encourages one to view music less as a collection of immutable structures and more as a subject for intentional creative perception. An analysis of Berg's Op. 2, No. 3 tests these ideas by bringing intentionalism and the biological basis of the mind to the forefront of the discussion.},

To this aims, the present paper investigates on whether and how positive and negative visual scenes may alter listeners’ ability to decode emotional melodies. Emotional tunes were played alone and with, either positive, or negative, or neutral emotional scenes. Afterword, subjects (8 groups, each of 38 subjects, equally balanced by gender) were asked to decode the emotional feeling aroused by melodies ascribing them either emotional valences (positive, negative, I don’t know) or emotional labels (happy, sad, fear, anger, another emotion, I don’t know). It was found that dimensional emotional features rather than emotional labels strongly affect cognitive judgements of emotional melodies. Musical emotional information is most effectively retained when the task is to assign labels rather than valence values to melodies. In addition, significant misperception effects are observed when happy or positively judged melodies are concurrently played with negative scenes.},

	abstract = {The composition of polyphonic chorale music in the style of J.S Bach has represented a major challenge in automatic music composi-tion over the last decades. The art of Bach chorales composition involves combining four-part harmony with characteristic rhythmic patterns and typical melodic movements to produce musical phrases which begin, evolve and end (cadences) in a harmonious way. To our knowledge, no model so far was able to solve all these problems simultaneously using an agnostic machine-learning approach. This paper introduces DeepBach, a statistical model aimed at modeling polyphonic music and specifically four parts, hymn-like pieces. We claim that, after being trained on the chorale harmonizations by Johann Sebastian Bach, our model is capable of generating highly convincing chorales in the style of Bach. We evalu-ate how indistinguishable our generated chorales are from existing Bach chorales with a listening test. The results corroborate our claim. A key strength of DeepBach is that it is agnostic and flexible. Users can con-strain the generation by imposing some notes, rhythms or cadences in the generated score. This allows users to reharmonize user-defined melodies. DeepBach's generation is fast, making it usable for interactive music composition applications. Several generation examples are provided and discussed from a musical point of view.},

	abstract = {In modern Western music, melody is commonly conveyed by pitch changes in the highest-register voice, whereas meter or rhythm is often carried by instruments with lower pitches. An intriguing and recently suggested possibility is that the custom of assigning rhythmic functions to lower-pitch instruments may have emerged because of fundamental properties of the auditory system that result in superior time encoding for low pitches. Here we compare rhythm and synchrony perception between low- and high-frequency tones, using both behavioral and EEG techniques. Both methods were consistent in showing no superiority in time encoding for low over high frequencies. However, listeners were consistently more sensitive to timing differences between two nearly synchronous tones when the high-frequency tone followed the low-frequency tone than vice versa. The results demonstrate no superiority of low frequencies in timing judgments but reveal a robust asymmetry in the perception and neural coding of synchrony that reflects greater tolerance for delays of low- relative to high-frequency sounds than vice versa. We propose that this asymmetry exists to compensate for inherent and variable time delays in cochlear processing, as well as the acoustical properties of sound sources in the natural environment, thereby providing veridical perceptual experiences of simultaneity.},

Despite the prevalence of sounds rich in harmonic structures in our everyday hearing environment, it has remained largely unknown what neural mechanisms are used by the primate auditory cortex to extract these biologically important acoustic structures. In this study, we discovered a unique class of harmonic template neurons in the core region of auditory cortex of a highly vocal New World primate, the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), across the entire hearing frequency range. Marmosets have a rich vocal repertoire and a similar hearing range to that of humans. Responses of these neurons show nonlinear facilitation to harmonic complex sounds over inharmonic sounds, selectivity for particular harmonic structures beyond two-tone combinations, and sensitivity to harmonic number and spectral regularity. Our findings suggest that the harmonic template neurons in auditory cortex may play an important role in processing sounds with harmonic structures, such as animal vocalizations, human speech, and music.},

This melodic harmonisation system can be used, not only to mimic given harmonic styles, but, to generate novel harmonisations for diverse melodies by exploring the harmonic possibilities provided by the implied harmonies of input melodies, or by allowing the imposition of user-defined chord constraints leading thus to new unforeseen harmonic realisations.

	abstract = {An empirical investigation of how local harmonic structures (e.g., chord progressions) contribute to the experience and enjoyment of uplifting trance (UT) music is presented. The connection between rhythmic and percussive elements and resulting trance-like states has been highlighted by musicologists, but no research, to our knowledge, has explored whether repeated harmonic elements influence affective responses in listeners of trance music. Two alternative hypotheses are discussed, the first highlighting the direct relationship between repetition/complexity and enjoyment, and the second based on the theoretical inverted-U relationship described by the Wundt curve. We investigate the connection between harmonic structure and subjective enjoyment through interdisciplinary behavioral and computational methods: First we discuss an experiment in which listeners provided enjoyment ratings for computer-generated UT anthems with varying levels of harmonic repetition and complexity. The anthems were generated using a statistical model trained on a corpus of 100 uplifting trance anthems created for this purpose, and harmonic structure was constrained by imposing particular repetition structures (semiotic patterns defining the order of chords in the sequence) on a professional UT music production template. Second, the relationship between harmonic structure and enjoyment is further explored using two computational approaches, one based on average Information Content, and another that measures average tonal tension between chords. The results of the listening experiment indicate that harmonic repetition does in fact contribute to the enjoyment of uplifting trance music. More compelling evidence was found for the second hypothesis discussed above, however some maximally repetitive structures were also preferred. Both computational models provide evidence for a Wundt-type relationship between complexity and enjoyment. By systematically manipulating the structure of chord progressions, we have discovered specific harmonic contexts in which repetitive or complex structure contribute to the enjoyment of uplifting trance music.},

Recursion, the ability to embed structures within structures of the same kind, has been proposed as a key component of our ability to parse and generate complex hierarchies. Here, we investigated the cognitive representation of both recursive and iterative processes in the auditory domain. The experiment used a two-alternative forced-choice paradigm: participants were exposed to three-step processes in which pure-tone sequences were built either through recursive or iterative processes, and had to choose the correct completion. Foils were constructed according to generative processes that did not match the previous steps. Both musicians and non-musicians were able to represent recursion in the auditory domain, although musicians performed better. We also observed that general ‘musical’ aptitudes played a role in both recursion and iteration, although the influence of musical training was somehow independent from melodic memory. Moreover, unlike iteration, recursion in audition was well correlated with its non-auditory (recursive) analogues in the visual and action sequencing domains. These results suggest that the cognitive machinery involved in establishing recursive representations is domain-general, even though this machinery requires access to information resulting from domain-specific processes.},

	abstract = {In this review paper aimed at the non-specialist, we explore the use that neuroscientists and musicians have made of perceptual illusions based on ambiguity. The pivotal issue is auditory scene analysis (ASA), or what enables us to make sense of complex acoustic mixtures in order to follow, for instance, a single melody in the midst of an orchestra. In general, ASA uncovers the most likely physical causes that account for the waveform collected at the ears. However, the acoustical problem is ill-posed and it must be solved from noisy sensory input. Recently, the neural mechanisms implicated in the transformation of ambiguous sensory information into coherent auditory scenes have been investigated using so-called bistability illusions (where an unchanging ambiguous stimulus evokes a succession of distinct percepts in the mind of the listener). After reviewing some of those studies, we turn to music, which arguably provides some of the most complex acoustic scenes that a human listener will ever encounter. Interestingly, musicians will not always aim at making each physical source intelligible, but rather express one or more melodic lines with a small or large number of instruments. By means of a few musical illustrations and by using a computational model inspired by neuro-physiological principles, we suggest that this relies on a detailed (if perhaps implicit) knowledge of the rules of ASA and of its inherent ambiguity. We then put forward the opinion that some degree perceptual ambiguity may participate in our appreciation of music.},

A modern interpretation based on auditory scene analysis appears to have merit. However, this interpretation has yet to be tested empirically. Three experiments test the scene-analysis account using numerosity judgments for complex chords as the dependent measure. In Experiment 1, musician listeners show decreasing accuracy in numerosity judgments when an octave is present in the sonority – as predicted.

A number of new computational models accounting for some of the perceptual phenomena of ASA have been published recently. Here we provide a theoretically motivated review of these computational models, aiming to relate their guiding principles to the central issues of the theoretical framework of ASA. Specifically, we ask how they achieve the grouping and separation of sound elements and whether they implement some form of competition between alternative interpretations of the sound input. We consider the extent to which they include predictive processes, as important current theories suggest that perception is inherently predictive, and also how they have been evaluated. We conclude that current computational models of ASA are fragmentary in the sense that rather than providing general competing interpretations of ASA, they focus on assessing the utility of specific processes (or algorithms) for finding the causes of the complex acoustic signal. This leaves open the possibility for integrating complementary aspects of the models into a more comprehensive theory of ASA.},

	abstract = {Extensive psychological experiments were carried out in this Part I on the consonance sensation of various dyad tones consisting of two components. As the frequencies of two components f 1 and f 2 (with an equal SPL) separate, the consonance gradually decreases down to the most dissonant point, whereafter it monotonically increases and mostly recovers at an octave separation. This consonance characteristic turned out to show a simple V curve if consonance is plotted against the frequency percent deviation in a logarithmic scale, and it suggests a dynamic and a static factor in consonance perception. The most dissonant frequency deviation is approximately 10\% at f 1=440 Hz, and it increased with sound pressure and frequency, but it was not simply proportional to the critical bandwidth. For dyads whose two components have different sound‐pressure levels (SPLs)L 1 and L 2, the consonance differs with spectrum forms, even when the level difference is the same. A dyad with a spectrum form (P 1{\textgreater}P 2, f 1{\textless}f 2) was more dissonant than that with its opposite spectrum form (P 1 {\textless} P 2). This asymmetrical property suggests a common origin in consonance perception with that observed in pure‐tune masking or neural response pattern. The results obtained in this Part I provide fundamental data to theoretical consonance calculation to be described in Part II for static complex tones consisting of more than three components.},

In our study, an auditory version of the solitaire illusion was demonstrated. Participants were asked to judge if they perceived more drum or piano sounds. When half of the piano tones were perceived as lower in pitch than a drum sound and the other half higher, piano tones appeared to be arranged in small units, leading to numerosity underestimation. Conversely, when all piano tones were perceived to be higher in pitch than the drum sounds, they appeared to be arranged in a single large unit, leading to numerosity overestimation. Comparable to the visual version of the solitaire illusion, the clustering seems to be determined by Gestalt principles. In our auditory version, a clear reversal of the illusion (numerosity overestimation or underestimation) was observed when piano tones appeared to be arranged in a single large cluster or in several small clusters, respectively.},

	abstract = {An empirical investigation of how local harmonic structures (e.g., chord progressions) contribute to the experience and enjoyment of uplifting trance (UT) music is presented. The connection between rhythmic and percussive elements and resulting trance-like states has been highlighted by musicologists, but no research, to our knowledge, has explored whether repeated harmonic elements influence affective responses in listeners of trance music. Two alternative hypotheses are discussed, the first highlighting the direct relationship between repetition/complexity and enjoyment, and the second based on the theoretical inverted-U relationship described by the Wundt curve. We investigate the connection between harmonic structure and subjective enjoyment through interdisciplinary behavioral and computational methods: First we discuss an experiment in which listeners provided enjoyment ratings for computer-generated UT anthems with varying levels of harmonic repetition and complexity. The anthems were generated using a statistical model trained on a corpus of 100 uplifting trance anthems created for this purpose, and harmonic structure was constrained by imposing particular repetition structures (semiotic patterns defining the order of chords in the sequence) on a professional UT music production template. Second, the relationship between harmonic structure and enjoyment is further explored using two computational approaches, one based on average Information Content, and another that measures average tonal tension between chords. The results of the listening experiment indicate that harmonic repetition does in fact contribute to the enjoyment of uplifting trance music. More compelling evidence was found for the second hypothesis discussed above, however some maximally repetitive structures were also preferred. Both computational models provide evidence for a Wundt-type relationship between complexity and enjoyment. By systematically manipulating the structure of chord progressions, we have discovered specific harmonic contexts in which repetitive or complex structure contribute to the enjoyment of uplifting trance music.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.cortex.2016.12.010},
	abstract = {Sentences encode hierarchical structural relations among words. Several neuroimaging experiments aiming to localize combinatory operations responsible for creating this structure during sentence comprehension have contrasted short, simple phrases and sentences to unstructured controls. Some of these experiments have revealed activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), associating these regions with basic syntactic combination. However, the wide variability of these effects across studies raises questions about this interpretation. In an fMRI experiment, we provide support for an alternative hypothesis: these regions underlie top-down syntactic predictions that facilitate sentence processing but are not necessary for building syntactic structure. We presented stimuli with three levels of structure: unstructured lists, two-word phrases, and simple, short sentences; and two levels of content: natural stimuli with real words and stimuli with open-class items replaced with pseudowords (jabberwocky). While both the phrase and sentence conditions engaged syntactic combination, our experiment only encouraged syntactic prediction in the sentence condition. We found increased activity for both natural and jabberwocky sentences in the left IFG (pars triangularis and pars orbitalis) and pSTS relative to unstructured word lists and two-word phrases, but we did not find any such effects for two-word phrases relative to unstructured word lists in these areas. Our results are most consistent with the hypothesis that increased activity in IFG and pSTS for basic contrasts of structure reflects syntactic prediction. The pars opercularis of the IFG showed a response profile consistent with verbal working memory. We found incremental effects of structure in the anterior temporal lobe (ATL), and increased activation only for sentences in the angular gyrus (AG)/temporal–parietal junction (AG/TPJ) – both regions showed these effects for stimuli with all real words. These findings support a role for the ATL in semantic combination and the AG/TPJ in thematic processing.},

	abstract = {Music is a unique communication system for human beings. Iconic musical meaning is one dimension of musical meaning, which emerges from musical information resembling sounds of objects, qualities of objects, or qualities of abstract concepts. The present study investigated whether congenital amusia, a disorder of musical pitch perception, impacts processing of iconic musical meaning. With a cross-modal semantic priming paradigm, target images were primed by semantically congruent or incongruent musical excerpts, which were characterized by direction (upward or downward) of pitch change (Experiment 1), or were selected from natural music (Experiment 2). Twelve Mandarin-speaking amusics and 12 controls performed a recognition (implicit) and a semantic congruency judgment (explicit) task while their EEG waveforms were recorded. Unlike controls, amusics failed to elicit an N400 effect when musical meaning was represented by direction of pitch change, regardless of the nature of the tasks (implicit versus explicit). However, the N400 effect in response to musical meaning in natural musical excerpts was observed for both groups in both types of tasks. These results indicate that amusics are able to process iconic musical meaning through multiple acoustic cues in natural musical excerpts, but not through direction of pitch change. This is the first study to investigate the processing of musical meaning in congenital amusia, providing evidence in support of the “melodic contour deafness hypothesis” with regard to iconic musical meaning processing in this disorder.},

	abstract = {The recent development of various methods of modulation such as PCM and PPM which exchange bandwidth for signal-to-noise ratio has intensified the interest in a general theory of communication. A basis for such a theory is contained in the important papers of Nyquist and Hartley on this subject. In the present paper we will extend the theory to include a number of new factors, in particular the effect of noise in the channel, and the savings possible due to the statistical structure of the original message and due to the nature of the final destination of the information. The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at another point. Frequently the messages have meaning; that is they refer to or are correlated according to some system with certain physical or conceptual entities. These semantic aspects of communication are irrelevant to the engineering problem. The significant aspect is that the actual message is one selected from a set of possible messages. The system must be designed to operate for each possible selection, not just the one which will actually be chosen since this is unknown at the time of design. If the number of messages in the set is finite then this number or any monotonic function of this number can be regarded as a measure of the information produced when one message is chosen from the set, all choices being equally likely. As was pointed out by Hartley the most natural choice is the logarithmic function. Although this definition must be generalized considerably when we consider the influence of the statistics of the message and when we have a continuous range of messages, we will in all cases use an essentially logarithmic measure.},

Recent advances in the modeling of apparent-motion effects in vision provide a starting point for the modeling of the strong apparent-motion effects in music. An adaptation of the Grossberg-Rudd model of apparent motion in vision, when given input representing the strengths of pitch sensations positioned along a one-dimensional frequency continuum, can simulate important musical phenomena of auditory stream segregation, van Noorden's melodic-fission/temporal-coherence boundaries, various Gestalt effects, aspects of dynamic attending, and Narmour's predicted categorical distinction between musical intervals implying a continuation and those implying a reversal of direction.},

Here we investigated whether a single motif presented in two voices is encoded as a single entity or two separate entities, and whether motifs overlapping in time impede or enhance encoding strength. Electroencephalogram (EEG) from 11 musically-trained participants was recorded while they passively listened to sequences of 5-note motifs where the 5th note either descended (standard) or ascended (deviant) relative to the previous note (20\% deviant rate). Motifs were presented either in one pitch range, or alternated between two pitch ranges, creating an “upper” and a “lower” voice. Further, motifs were either temporally isolated (silence in between), or temporally concurrent with two tones overlapping. When motifs were temporally isolated, MMN amplitude in the one-pitch-range condition was similar to that in the two-pitch-range upper voice. In contrast, no MMN, but P3a, was observed in the two-pitch-range lower voice. When motifs were temporally concurrent and presented in two pitch ranges, MMN exhibited a more posterior distribution in the upper voice, but again, was absent in the lower voice. These results suggest that motifs presented in two separate voices are not encoded entirely independently, but hierarchically, causing asymmetry between the upper and lower voice encoding even when no simultaneous pitches are presented.},

Within a comparative approach to animal communication systems, I hypothesize that the ability for emotional and interactional prosody (EIP) paved the way for the evolution of linguistic prosody - and perhaps also of music, continuing to play a vital role in the acquisition of language. In support of this hypothesis, I review three research fields: (i) empirical studies on the adaptive value of EIP in non-human primates, mammals, songbirds, anurans, and insects; (ii) the beneficial effects of EIP in scaffolding language learning and social development in human infants; (iii) the cognitive relationship between linguistic prosody and the ability for music, which has often been identified as the evolutionary precursor of language.},

	abstract = {Music is a powerful means for communicating emotions among individuals. Here we reveal that this continuous stream of affective information is commonly represented in the brains of different listeners and that particular musical attributes mediate this link. We examined participants' brain responses to two naturalistic musical pieces using functional Magnetic Resonance imaging (fMRI). Following scanning, as participants listened to the musical pieces for a second time, they continuously indicated their emotional experience on scales of valence and arousal. These continuous reports were used along with a detailed annotation of the musical features, to predict a novel index of Dynamic Common Activation (DCA) derived from ten large-scale data-driven functional networks. We found an association between the unfolding music-induced emotionality and the DCA modulation within a vast network of limbic regions. The limbic-DCA modulation further corresponded with continuous changes in two temporal musical features: beat-strength and tempo. Remarkably, this “collective limbic sensitivity” to temporal features was found to mediate the link between limbic-DCA and the reported emotionality. An additional association with the emotional experience was found in a left fronto-parietal network, but only among a sub-group of participants with a high level of musical experience ({\textgreater}5years). These findings may indicate two processing-levels underlying the unfolding of common music emotionality; (1) a widely shared core-affective process that is confined to a limbic network and mediated by temporal regularities in music and (2) an experience based process that is rooted in a left fronto-parietal network that may involve functioning of the ‘mirror-neuron system’.},

Given onset data, the metrical structure of a piece is interpreted using the Inner Metric Analysis (IMA) model. IMA identifies the strong and weak metrical positions in a piece by performing a periodicity analysis, resulting in a weight profile for the entire piece. Next, we reduce IMA to a feature vector and model the detection of the meter and its first downbeat position prob-abilistically. In order to solve the meter detection prob-lem effectively, we explore various feature selection and parameter optimisation strategies, including Genetic, Max-imum Likelihood, and Expectation-Maximisation algo-rithms. PRIMA is evaluated on two datasets of MIDI files: a corpus of ragtime pieces, and a newly assembled pop dataset. We show that PRIMA outperforms autocorrelation-based meter detection as implemented in the MIDItoolbox on these datasets.},

Hence comparing the structural descriptions generated by the model to results of a listening experiment helps to link music theoretic and perceptual studies.},

Mentally parsing and representing such structures, however, poses challenges for speech comprehension. In speech, hierarchical linguistic structures do not have boundaries that are clearly defined by acoustic cues and must therefore be internally and incrementally constructed during comprehension. We found that, during listening to connected speech, cortical activity of different timescales concurrently tracked the time course of abstract linguistic structures at different hierarchical levels, such as words, phrases and sentences. Notably, the neural tracking of hierarchical linguistic structures was dissociated from the encoding of acoustic cues and from the predictability of incoming words. Our results indicate that a hierarchy of neural processing timescales underlies grammar-based internal construction of hierarchical linguistic structure.},

	abstract = {Swets et al. (2008) present evidence that the so-called ambiguity advantage (Traxler et al., 1998), which has been explained in terms of the Unrestricted Race Model, can equally well be explained by assuming underspecification in ambiguous conditions driven by task-demands. Specifically, if comprehension questions require that ambiguities be resolved, the parser tends to make an attachment: when questions are about superficial aspects of the target sentence, readers tend to pursue an underspecification strategy. It is reason-able to assume that individual differences in strategy will play a significant role in the application of such strategies, so that studying average behavior may not be informative. In order to study the predictions of the good-enough processing theory, we implemented two versions of underspecification: the partial specification model (PSM), which is an implementation of the Swets et al. proposal, and a more parsimonious version, the non-specification model (NSM). We evaluate the relative fit of these two kinds of underspecification to Swets et al.'s data; as a baseline, we also fit three models that assume no underspecification. We find that a model without unspecification pro-vides a somewhat better fit than both underspecification models, while the NSM model provides a better fit than the PSM. We interpret the results as lack of unambiguous evidence in favor of underspecification; however, given that there is considerable existing evidence for good-enough processing in the literature, it is reasonable to assume that some underspecification might occur. Under this assumption, the results can be interpreted as tentative ev-idence for NSM over PSM. More generally, our work provides a method for choosing between models of real-time processes in sentence comprehension that make qualitative predictions about the relationship between several de-pendent variables. We believe that sentence processing research will greatly benefit from a wider use of such methods.},

	abstract = {Mathematics and musicology have a long-standing relationship, but it is less productive than it might be. Reasons for this are explored in case studies of the ‘gap-fill’ melodic principle and of motivic analysis. In the first case empirical results do not unequivocally support the principle, but it continues to be used by musicologists. In the second, mathematical and computational approaches are found to differ significantly from those of music analysis in their purpose and effect. Other differences between the disciplines are examined in the use of metaphor in musical discourse, and misunderstandings over the role of abstraction and estimation. Throughout, human factors are found to confound proper communication. I propose that better interdisciplinary research could arise from honesty about limitations, effort in understanding each other’s disciplines, and humility about achievements. The response to Guerino Mazzola defends the use of imprecise concepts in some circumstances, particularly in the light of the impossibility of a precise definition of the domain of music. A possible contribution of mathematics to music through the demonstration of relationships between formulations of different theories is envisaged, specifically those of species counterpoint and functional harmony. In response to the contribution to this volume by Geraint Wiggins, I ask what music theory is for, and argue that, through education and the activity of composers, it has an influence on the very music it aims to describe. I defend Schoenberg from the charge of ignoring musical perception, and claim his music is successful even if not in the way he had envisaged. The music theoretic enterprise, including its mathematical branch, has an effect on musical culture, but that effect might be difficult to predict. Apparently contrasting ontologies of music as a psychological-cognitive entity or as having independent existence are shown not to be mutually exclusive. They are related to orthogonal dimensions of empirical and rational approaches in research. The best research employs both approaches.

	abstract = {Languages employ different strategies to transmit structural and grammatical information. While, for example, grammatical dependency relationships in sentences are mainly conveyed by the ordering of the words for languages like Mandarin Chinese, or Vietnamese, the word ordering is much less restricted for languages such as Inupiatun or Quechua, as those languages (also) use the internal structure of words (e.g. inflectional morphology) to mark grammatical relationships in a sentence. Based on a quantitative analysis of more than 1,500 unique translations of different books of the Bible in more than 1,100 different languages that are spoken as a native language by approximately 6 billion people (more than 80\% of the world population), we present large-scale evidence for a statistical trade-off between the amount of information conveyed by the ordering of words and the amount of information conveyed by internal word structure: languages that rely more strongly on word order information tend to rely less on word structure information and vice versa. In addition, we find that - despite differences in the way information is expressed - there is also evidence for a trade-off between different books of the biblical canon that recurs with little variation across languages: the more informative the word order of the book, the less informative its word structure and vice versa. We argue that this might suggest that, on the one hand, languages encode information in very different (but efficient) ways. On the other hand, content-related and stylistic features are statistically encoded in very similar ways.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

	abstract = {Mathematics and musicology have a long-standing relationship, but it is less productive than it might be. Reasons for this are explored in case studies of the ‘gap-fill’ melodic principle and of motivic analysis. In the first case empirical results do not unequivocally support the principle, but it continues to be used by musicologists. In the second, mathematical and computational approaches are found to differ significantly from those of music analysis in their purpose and effect. Other differences between the disciplines are examined in the use of metaphor in musical discourse, and misunderstandings over the role of abstraction and estimation. Throughout, human factors are found to confound proper communication. I propose that better interdisciplinary research could arise from honesty about limitations, effort in understanding each other’s disciplines, and humility about achievements. The response to Guerino Mazzola defends the use of imprecise concepts in some circumstances, particularly in the light of the impossibility of a precise definition of the domain of music. A possible contribution of mathematics to music through the demonstration of relationships between formulations of different theories is envisaged, specifically those of species counterpoint and functional harmony. In response to the contribution to this volume by Geraint Wiggins, I ask what music theory is for, and argue that, through education and the activity of composers, it has an influence on the very music it aims to describe. I defend Schoenberg from the charge of ignoring musical perception, and claim his music is successful even if not in the way he had envisaged. The music theoretic enterprise, including its mathematical branch, has an effect on musical culture, but that effect might be difficult to predict. Apparently contrasting ontologies of music as a psychological-cognitive entity or as having independent existence are shown not to be mutually exclusive. They are related to orthogonal dimensions of empirical and rational approaches in research. The best research employs both approaches. Mathematical and computational researchers are urged to explore research which moves away from the abstract, rational approach and makes greater use of empirical data. Suggestions are given for future research.},

The situations include multiple testing, deciding when to stop running participants, and when a theory was thought of relative to finding out results. The interpretation of nonsignificant results has also been persistently problematic in a way that Bayesian inference can clarify. The Bayesian and orthodox approaches are placed in the context of different notions of rationality, and I accuse myself and others as having been irrational in the way we have been using statistics on a key notion of rationality.

The model is employed to assign prolongational structure, represent paths through the space, and compute patterns of tension and attraction as musical events unfold, thereby providing a partial basis for understanding musical narration, expectation, and expression. Conceived as both a music-theoretic treatise and a contribution to the cognitive science of music, this book will be of interest to music theorists, musicologists, composers, computer musicians, and cognitive psychologists.},

	abstract = {Why do we enjoy listening to music that makes us sad? This question has puzzled music psychologists for decades, but the paradox of “pleasurable sadness” remains to be solved. Recent findings from a study investigating the enjoyment of sad films suggest that the positive relationship between felt sadness and enjoyment might be explained by feelings of being moved (Hanich et al., 2014). The aim of the present study was to investigate whether feelings of being moved also mediated the enjoyment of sad music. In Experiment 1, 308 participants listened to 5 sad music excerpts and rated their liking and felt emotions. A multilevel mediation analysis revealed that the initial positive relationship between liking and felt sadness (r = .22) was fully mediated by feelings of being moved. Experiment 2 explored the interconnections of perceived sadness, beauty, and movingness in 27 short music excerpts that represented independently varying levels of sadness and beauty. Two multilevel mediation analyses were carried out to test competing hypotheses: A) that movingness mediates the effect of perceived sadness on liking, or B) that perceived beauty mediates the effect of sadness on liking. Stronger support was obtained for Hypothesis A. Our findings suggest that – similarly to the enjoyment of sad films – the aesthetic appreciation of sad music is mediated by being moved. We argue that felt sadness may contribute to the enjoyment of sad music by intensifying feelings of being moved.},

Four works are analyzed: Skrjabin's Vers la flamme, Berg's op. 2, no. 2, Debussy's Voiles, and Webern's op. 3, no. 1. It is suggested that in these works such harmonies are prolonged in ways roughly analogous to the Schenkerian concept of prolongation. The theoretical principles of prolongation are treated in detail on the basis of Joseph Straus's conditions of prolongation. The psychoacoustical significance of the approximation of harmonics is discussed on the basis of virtual-pitch perception. Abstract Source: author{\textbackslash}n2002-09814},

But there have been few attempts to explain the music of Schoenberg, Berg, and Webern in these terms; the music of atonality and serialism does not readily yield to analysis from the standpoint of directed motion. Such an approach implies not only the possibility of recognizing clearly established origins and goals of motion, but the concomitant possibility of understanding the details of such motions as elaborations on various levels (foreground, middle-ground, or background) of a primordial progression or structure which can be assumed to underlie the entire composition and to unfold through time some sort of tonic sonority, triadic or otherwise.' The difficulty of attacking atonal and serial music with this set of assumptions seems obvious. Nevertheless, in reconsidering two brief piano pieces by Schoenberg and Webern, respectively, I have been tempted to set down in the discussion that follows a number of obser-vations made from this point of view. As it happens, both of the compositions in question have been analyzed from quite different vantage points in separate articles that appeared in the second issue of},

It can take place, however, only under certain musical conditions, including the systematic distinction between consonance and dissonance, a consistent set of relationships between tones of greater and lesser structural weight, and a clear differentiation of harmony from voice-leading. Posttonal music generally fails to meet these conditions and thus thwarts analysis in prolongational terms. To understand the middleground structure of posttonal music, we must employ instead an analytical model based on association, linking together distant tones by virtue of their shared register, timbre, metrical placement, or articulation.

I argue that these questions imply mistaken assumptions about the content and origin of Schenker's theories, the role of analysis, the function of dissonance in common-practice harmony and in jazz, the nature of improvisation as opposed to composition, and the role of simplicity and complexity in popular and classical music. While my answers qualify the applicability of Schenker's theories to jazz, they also emphasize the importance of models in creating, explaining, and experiencing jazz.},

	title = {Interpreting {P} values},
	volume = {14},
	doi = {10.1038/nmeth.4210},
	abstract = {A P value measures a sample's compatibility with a hypothesis, not the truth of the hypothesis. Although P values are convenient and popular summaries of exper-imental results, we can be led astray if we consider them as our only metric 1 . Even in the ideal case of a rigorously designed randomized study fit to a predetermined model, P values still need to be supple-mented with other information to avoid misinterpretation. A P value is a probability statement about the observed sample in the context of a hypothesis, not about the hypotheses being tested. For example, suppose we wish to know whether disease affects the level of a biomarker. The P value of a comparison of the mean biomarker levels in healthy versus diseased samples would be the probability that a difference in means at least as large as the one observed can be generated from random samples if the disease does not affect the mean biomarker level. It is not the probability of the biomarker-level means in the two samples being equal—they either are or are not equal. However, this relationship between P values and inference about hypotheses is a critical point—interpretation of statistical analysis depends on it. It is one of the key themes in the American Statistical Association's statement on statistical significance and P values 2 , published to mitigate widespread misuse and misinterpretation of P values. This relationship is discussed in some of the 18 short com-mentaries that accompany the statement, from which three main ideas for using, interpreting and reporting P values emerge: the use of more stringent P value cutoffs supported by Bayesian analysis, use of the observed P value to estimate false discovery rate (FDR), and the combination of P values and effect sizes to create more informative confidence intervals. The first two of these ideas are currently most useful as guidelines for assessing how strongly the data support null versus alternative hypotheses, whereas the third could be used to assess how strongly the data support parameter values in the confidence interval. However, like P values, these methods will be biased toward the alternative hypothesis when used with a P value selected from the most significant of multiple tests or models 1 . To illustrate these three ideas, let's expand on the biomarker exam-ple above with the null hypothesis that disease does not influence the biomarker level. For samples, we'll use n = 10 individuals, ran-domly chosen from each of the unaffected and affected populations, assumed to be normally distributed with σ 2 = 1. At this sample size, a two-sample t-test has 80\% power to reject the null at significance a = 0.05 when the effect size is 1.32 (Fig. 1a). Suppose that we observe a difference in sample means of 1.2 and that our samples have a pooled s.d. of s p = 1.1. These give us t = 1.2/(s p √(2/n)) = 2.44 with d.f. = 2(n – 1) = 18 and a P value of 0.025. Once a P value has been computed, it is useful to assess the strength of evidence of the truth or falsehood of the null hypoth-esis. Here we can look to Bayesian analysis for ways to make this connection 3 , where decisions about statistical significance can be based on the Bayes factor, B, which is the ratio of average likeli-hoods under the alternative and null hypotheses. However, using Bayesian analysis adds an element of subjectivity because it requires the specification of a prior distribution for the model parameters under both hypotheses. Benjamin and Berger, in their discussion in ref. 2, note that the P value can be used to compute an upper bound for the Bayes factor, . The bound does not require the specification of a prior and holds for many reasonable choices of priors. For example, = 10 means that the alternative hypothesis is at most ten times more likely to be true than the null. Because it quantifies the extent to which the alternative hypothesis is more likely, the Bayes factor can be used for significance testing. Decision boundaries for the Bayes factor are less prescriptive than those for P values, with descriptors such as " anectodal, " " substantial, " " strong " and " decisive " often used for cutoff values. The exact terms and corresponding values vary across the literature, and their inter-pretation requires active consideration on the part of the researcher 4 . A Bayes factor of 20 or more is generally considered to be strong evi-dence for the alternative hypothesis. The Benjamin and Berger bound is given by ≤ –1/(e P ln(P)) for a given P value 5 (Fig. 1b). For example, when we reject the null at P {\textless} a = 0.05, we do so when the alternative hypothesis is at most ≤ 2.5 times more likely than the null! This significance boundary is considered by many Bayesians to be extremely weak to nonexistent evidence against the null hypothesis. For our biomarker example, we found P = 0.025 and thus conclude that the alternative hypothesis that disease affects the biomarker level is at most ≤ 3.9 times more likely than the null. If we insist on {\textgreater} 20, which corresponds to 'strong' evidence for the alternative, we need P {\textless} 0.0032 (Fig. 1b). Johnson, in a discussion in ref. 2, suggests testing at P {\textless} a = 0.005 ({\textgreater} 14) for statistical significance (Fig. 1b). Notice that the computation for does not use the power of the test. If we compute power using the same effect size of 1.32 but reject the null at a {\textless} 0.005 ({\textgreater} 14), the power is only 43\% (Fig. 1c). To achieve 80\% power at this cutoff, we would need a sample size of n = 18. Altman (this author), in a discussion in ref. 2, proposes to supple-ment P values with an estimate of the FDR by using plug-in values to account for both the power of the test and the prior evidence in Figure 1 {\textbar} Using a Bayesian heuristic to interpret the P value. (a) Power drops at more stringent P value cutoffs a. The curve is based on a two-sample t-test with n = 10 and an effect size of 1.32. (b) The Benjamin and Berger bound calibrates the P value to probability statements about the hypothesis. At P = 0.05, the bound suggests that our alternative hypothesis is at most 2.5 times more likely than the null (black dashed line). Also shown are the conventional Bayesian B – = 20 (blue dashed line; P = 0.0032) cutoff},

Virtually all such theories are predicated on tunable instruments (e.g. strings), whereas the voice is the most ancestral and universal instrument used to make music. In the present study, we analysed the tuning of sung musical intervals from a familiar song, doing so across both trained and untrained singers. Contrary to the predictions of traditional theories, we found that sung intervals (unlike those of instruments) showed marked overlap with neighbouring interval categories. Furthermore, we found that listeners of these sung productions did not base their aesthetic judgments of singing quality on the precision of tuning of sung intervals. We consolidate these results into a model of tonality based on both vocal and sensory factors that contribute to the formation of sung melodies.},

For example, if I flip a coin, the outcome of that toss is something you might want to know.1 Information theory is fundamentally about signals, not the meaning they carry. What we mea- sure thus requires interpretation. Conversely, in its universality, information theory applies just as much to the written and spoken words of humans as to the electronic machines for which it was first developed. And it allows us to compare quite very distant worlds—no more, and no less, exciting than, say, comparing the real income of a English bricklayer in 1350 to one in 1780, the hours worked by a French housewife in 1810 and 1950, or the life expectancy of a hunter-gatherer of the Maasai to that of a child in a Manchester factory of 1840.},

These approaches are coupled with a deep-seated, often tacit, belief in the reductionist program for understanding the link between the brain and behavior. The aim of this program is causal explanation through neural manipulations that allow testing of necessity and sufficiency claims. We argue, however, that another equally important approach seeks an alternative form of understanding through careful theoretical and experimental decomposition of behavior. Specifically, the detailed analysis of tasks and of the behavior they elicit is best suited for discovering compo-nent processes and their underlying algorithms. In most cases, we argue that study of the neural implemen-tation of behavior is best investigated after such behavioral work. Thus, we advocate a more pluralistic notion of neuroscience when it comes to the brain-behavior relationship: behavioral work provides understanding, whereas neural interventions test causality.},

We show how this stochastic process can be used as a prior distribution in a Bayesian nonparametric model of document collections. Specifically, we present an application to information retrieval in which documents are modeled as paths down a random tree, and the preferential attachment dynamics of the nCRP leads to clustering of documents according to sharing of topics at multiple levels of abstraction. Given a corpus of documents, a posterior inference algorithm finds an approximation to a posterior distribution over trees, topics and allocations of words to levels of the tree. We demonstrate this algorithm on collections of scientific abstracts from several journals. This model exemplifies a recent trend in statistical machine learning--the use of Bayesian nonparametric methods to infer distributions on flexible data structures.},

The model hyperparameters are inferred using a Gibbs EM algorithm. On two data sets, each of 150 documents, the new model exhibits better predictive accuracy than either a hierarchical Dirichlet bigram language model or a unigram topic model. Additionally, the inferred topics are less dominated by function words than are topics discovered using unigram statistics, potentially making them more meaningful.},

We discuss its connections to probabilistic modeling, and describe two kinds of algorithms for topic discovery. We then survey the growing body of research that extends and applies topic models in interesting ways. These extensions have been developed by relaxing some of the statistical assumptions of LDA, incorporating meta-data into the analysis of the documents, and using similar kinds of models on a diversity of data types such as social networks, images and genetics. Finally, we give our thoughts as to some of the important unexplored directions for topic modeling. These include rigorous methods for checking models built for data exploration, new approaches to visualizing text and other high dimensional data, and moving beyond traditional information engineering applications towards using topic models for more scientific ends.},

Each document has a distribution over latent topics, as in topic models, which provides the semantic consistency. Each element in the dependency parse tree also has a distribution over the topics of its children, as in latent-state syntax models, which provides the syntactic consistency. These distributions are convolved so that the topic of each word is likely under both its document and syntactic context. We derive a fast posterior inference algorithm based on variational methods.

Given our desire to tie the mixture models in the various groups, we consider a hierarchical model, specifically one in which the base measure for the child Dirichlet processes is itself distributed according to a Dirichlet process. Such a base measure being discrete, the child Dirichlet processes necessarily share atoms. Thus, as desired, the mixture models in the different groups necessarily share mixture components. We discuss representations of hierarchical Dirichlet processes in terms of a stick-breaking process, and a generalization of the Chinese restaurant process that we refer to as the “Chinese restaurant franchise.” We present Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for posterior inference in hierarchical Dirichlet process mixtures and describe applications to problems in information retrieval and text modeling.},

This corpus is based on data from classicalarchives.com, a repository of thousands of usergenerated MIDI representations of pieces from several periods of Western European music history. The YCAC makes available metadata for each MIDI file, as well as a list of pitch simultaneities ("salami slices") in the MIDI file. Metadata include the piece's composer, the composer's country of origin, date of composition, genre (e.g., symphony, piano sonata, nocturne, etc.), instrumentation, meter, and key. The processing step groups the file's pitches into vertical slices each time a pitch is added or subtracted from the texture, recording the slice's offset (measured in the number of quarter notes separating the event from the file's beginning), highest pitch, lowest pitch, prime form, scale-degrees in relation to the global key (as determined by experts), and local key information (as determined by a windowed key-profile analysis). The corpus contains 13,769 MIDI files by 571 composers yielding over 14,051,144 vertical slices. This paper outlines several properties of this corpus, along with a representative study using this dataset. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Several new terms are introduced to facilitate the application of pitch-class set theory to descriptions of tonal pitch relations and to retain characteristic intervallic relationships in tonal music typically not found in discussions of atonal pitch-class relations. The description comprises three parts. First, pitch sets are converted to pitch-class sets. Second, the pitch-class sets are categorized by transpositional types. Third, the relations of these transpositional types are described in terms of their key center and modal references to the three diatonic sets. Further, it is suggested that the probability of a specific key interpretation by a listener may depend on the scale-degree functions of the tones.},

Slightly more than half of listeners' judgments matched the generating keys, on both the untimed and the timed conditions. While this performance is much better than chance, it also indicates that the distributional view is far from a complete explanation of human key identification. No difference was found between participants with regard to absolute pitch ability, either in the speed or accuracy of their key judgments. Several key-finding models were tested on the melodies to see which yielded the best match to participants' responses.},

Several studies, inspired by research on the statistical learning of language, have investigated statistical learning of sequential rules underlying tone sequences. Given that the mental representation of music correlates with distributional properties of music, we tested whether participants are able to abstract distributional information contained in tone sequences to form a mental representation. For this purpose, we created an unfamiliar music genre defined by an underlying tone distribution, to which 40 participants were exposed. Our stimuli allowed us to differentiate between sensitivity to the distributional properties contained in test stimuli and long term representation of the distributional properties of the music genre overall. Using a probe tone paradigm and a two-alternative forced choice discrimination task, we show that listeners are able to abstract distributional properties of music through mere exposure into a long term representation of music. This lends support to the idea that statistical learning is involved in the process of gaining musical knowledge.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {This paper presents an automatic harmonization method that, for a given melody (sequence of musical notes), gen-erates a sequence of chord symbols in the style of exist-ing data. A typical way is to use hidden Markov models (HMMs) that represent chord transitions on a regular grid (e.g., bar or beat grid). This approach, however, cannot explicitly describe the rhythms, harmonic functions (e.g., tonic, dominant, and subdominant), and the hierarchical structure of chords, which are supposedly important in tra-ditional harmony theories. To solve this, we formulate a hi-erarchical generative model consisting of (1) a probabilis-tic context-free grammar (PCFG) for chords incorporating their syntactic functions, (2) a metrical Markov model de-scribing chord rhythms, and (3) a Markov model generat-ing melodies conditionally on a chord sequence. To esti-mate a variable-length chord sequence for a given melody, we iteratively refine the latent tree structure and the chord symbols and rhythms using a Metropolis-Hastings sampler with split-merge operations. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperformed the HMM-based method in terms of predictive abilities.},

Our experiments on learning the probabilities for simple grammars from pitch sequences in two kinds of symbolic musical corpora are summarized.

A corpus formed by two newspapers, "La Gazette de Lausanne" and "Le Journal de Gen{\textbackslash}`eve", is used, providing 4 million articles from 200 years of archives. We first perform some classical measurements on this corpus in order to provide indicators and visualizations of linguistic evolution.

	abstract = {We explored the relationship between musical structure and emotion on different variations of La Folia – a musical theme of Portuguese origin based on a standard harmonic progression. Our approach aims to extend previous research by investigating more factors and comparing different models for music emotion. In a pilot study, 12 participants rated the emotion associated to the stimuli on a graduate scale from 1 to 10, according to 3 different models for music emotion: the valence/arousal-based emotion model (Russell, 1980), a discrete emotion approach (Izard, 1972), and the Geneva Emotional Music Scale (GEMS) (Zentner et al., 2008). Stimuli were commercial recordings of the first 8 bars of 32 variations of the Theme of La Folia by A. Scarlatti, C. P. E. Bach, S. Rachmaninov and F. Liszt, with different combinations of 9 factors that were judged and averaged by 2 musical experts using a 5-point rating scale. Preliminary results are: (i) there exist significant correlations between structural parameters and descriptors for emotions in all of the models; (ii) correlations between structure and emotion are more remarkable for the valence/arousal-based emotion model and for the GEMS model, and are higher for register, note density, dynamics, accentuation and articulation; (iii) agreement among raters for the DES model is significantly lower than for the other two models. On the base of these results, we planned two new experiments focussing only on the valence/arousal-based emotion model and on the first-order GEMS model. They are: a second listening test based on a real music design (20 out of the previously selected 32 stimuli, corresponding to pieces featuring more extreme variability in the musical structure, with different combinations of 21 factors), and a new listening test based on a controlled and balanced design (24 variations with selected combinations of 4 factors, arranged and recorded in a deadpan performance by the first author). 24 participants (12 musicians and 12 non-musicians) have been involved in the current study, following the same procedure outlined above. We expect to extend understanding on the relationship between structure and emotion following more accurate, computational analyses of musical features, as well as by defining new predictors for emotion that are more appropriate for specific musical style(s) – like factorial analysis or multidimensional scaling.},

We evaluate these algorithms by examining the quality of the ragtime music produced for eight excerpts of classical music alongside the output of a third algorithm run on the same excerpts; results are derived from a survey of 163 people who rated the quality of the ragtime output of the three algorithms.},

	abstract = {Whether music and language evolved independently of each other or whether both evolved from a common precursor remains a hotly debated topic. We here emphasize the role of vowels in the language-music relationship, arguing for a shared heritage of music and speech. Vowels play a decisive role in generating the sound or sonority of syllables, the main vehicles for transporting prosodic information in speech and singing. Timbre is, beyond question, the primary parameter that allows us to discriminate between different vowels, but vowels also have intrinsic pitch, intensity, and duration. There are striking correspondences between the number of vowels and the number of pitches in musical scales across cultures: a maximum of roughly 12 elements, a minimum of 2, a frequency peak at 5 to 7 elements, and the pentatonic scale and the 5-vowel systems as the most common. Moreover, we reveal coincidences between vowels and scales even in specific geographical regions and cultures. For example, languages with up to 4 vowels (e.g. Navaho, Cheyenne) tend to have tritonic or tetratonic scales, and languages with more than 5 vowels (e.g., Hopi) hexatonic or heptatonic scales. We will discuss the co-variation between vowel inventories and musical scales in the context of other ethnomusicological findings and with respect to singing and half-musical communication, both in ontogeny and phylogeny.},

	abstract = {Music must first be defined and distinguished from speech, and from animal and bird cries. We discuss the stages of hominid anatomy that permit music to be perceived and created, with the likelihood of both H. neanderthalensis and H. sapiens both being capable. The earlier hominid ability to emit sounds of variable pitch with some meaning, shows that music at its simplest level must have predated speech. The possibilities of anthropoid motor impulse suggest that rhythm may have preceded melody, though full control of rhythm may well not have come any earlier than the perception of music above. There are four evident purposes for music: dance, ritual, entertainment personal and communal, and above all social cohesion, again on both personal and communal levels. We then proceed to how instruments began, with a brief survey of the surviving examples from the Mousterian period onwards, including the possible Neanderthal evidence and the extent to which they showed ‘artistic’ potential in other fields. We warn that our performance on replicas of surviving instruments may bear little or no resemblance to that of the original players. We continue with how later instruments, strings and skin-drums began and developed into instruments we know in worldwide cultures today. The sound of music is then discussed, scales and intervals, and the lack of any consistency of consonant tonality around the world. This is followed by iconographic evidence of the instruments of later antiquity into the European Middle Ages, and finally the history of public performance, again from the possibilities of early humanity into more modern times. This paper draws the ethnomusicological perspective on the entire development of music, instruments, and performance, from the times of H. neanderthalensis and H. sapiens into those of modern musical history, and it is written with the deliberate intention of informing readers who are without special education in music, and providing necessary information for inquiries into the origin of music by cognitive scientists.},

	abstract = {The study of music is always, to some extent, "empirical," in that it involves testing ideas and interpretations against some kind of external reality. But in musicology, the kinds of empirical approaches familiar in the social sciences have played a relatively marginal role, being generally restricted to inter-disciplinary areas such as psychology and sociology of music. Rather than advocating a new kind of musicology, Empirical Musicology provides a guide to empirical approaches that are ready for incorporation into the contemporary musicologist's toolkit. Its nine chapters cover perspectives from music theory, computational musicology, ethnomusicology, and the psychology and sociology of music, as well as an introduction to musical data analysis and statistics. This book shows that such approaches could play an important role in the further development of the discipline as a whole, not only through the application of statistical and modeling methods to musical scores but also-and perhaps more importantly-in terms of understanding music as a complex social practice.},

In the first stage of ps13, the pitch name implied for a note by a tonic is assumed to be the one that lies closest to that tonic on the line of fifths. The strength with which a pitch name is implied for a note is assumed to be proportional to the sum of the frequencies of occurrence, within a context around the note, of the tonics that imply that pitch name. In the second stage of ps13, certain neighbour-note and passing-note errors in the output of the first stage are corrected. An implementation of ps13, called PS13, spelt correctly 99.31\% of the notes in a 195972 note test corpus, . A post-processing phase was added to PS13 in which the pitch names computed by PS13 are transposed by a diminished second if this brings them closer on the line of fifths to the pitch names of the notes in their vicinity. This version of the algorithm spelt 99.43\% of the notes in correctly. When...},

Considering both the distribution of melodic scale-degrees and the distribution of chords (roots), as well as the metrical placement of chords, leads to good key-finding performance. Finally, we discuss how songs within the corpus might be categorized with regard to their pitch organization.

Although the brain underpinnings of social cognition have been extensively studied, no empirical work has yet examined the impact of musical structure manipulation on the neural processing of emotional valence during mental state inferences. We used a novel sound-based theory-of-mind paradigm in which participants categorized stimuli of different sensory dissonance level in terms of positive/negative valence. Whilst consistent with previous studies which propose facilitated encoding of consonances, our results demonstrated that distinct levels of consonance/dissonance elicited differential influences on the right angular gyrus, an area implicated in mental state attribution and attention reorienting processes. Functional and effective connectivity analyses further showed that consonances modulated a specific inhibitory interaction from associative memory to mental state attribution substrates. Following evidence suggesting that individuals with autism may process social affective cues differently, we assessed the relationship between participants’ task performance and self-reported autistic traits in clinically typical adults. Higher scores on the social cognition scales of the AQ were associated with deficits in recognising positive valence in consonant sound cues. These findings are discussed with respect to Bayesian perspectives on autistic perception, which highlight a functional failure to optimize precision in relation to prior beliefs.},

The model's predictions for expectancies are described with a small number of principles specified precisely in terms of interval size and direction of pitch. These principles were quantified and used to predict the data from three experiments in which listeners were required to judge how well individual test tones continued melodic fragments. The model successfully predicted listeners' judgments across different musical styles (British and Chinese folk songs and Webern Lieder), regardless of the extent of listeners' musical training (Experiments 1 and 2) or whether they were born and raised in China or the U.S.A. (Experiment 3). For each experiment, however, the collinearity of the model's predictors indicated that a simplified version of the model might predict the data equally well. Indeed, a revised and simplified model did not result in a loss of predictive power for any of the three experiments. Convergent evidence was provided in a reanalysis of data reported by Carlsen (1981) and Unyk and Carlsen (1987), whose listeners were required to sing continuations to two-tone stimuli. Thus, these findings indicate that the implication-realization model is over-specified. The consistency that was found across experimental tasks, musical styles, and listeners raises the possibility, however, that the revised version of the model may withstand the original model's claims of universality.},

	abstract = {During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation and information technology. With it has come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It should be a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting-the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book. Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors of statistics at Stanford University. They are prominent researchers in this area: Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive models and wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie wrote much of the statistical modeling software in S-PLUS and invented principal curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the Lasso and is co-author of the very successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Friedman is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including CART, MARS, and projection pursuit. FROM THE REVIEWS: TECHNOMETRICS "This is a vast and complex book. Generally, it concentrates on explaining why and how the methods work, rather than how to use them. Examples and especially the visualizations are principle features...As a source for the methods of statistical learning...it will probably be a long time before there is a competitor to this book."},

This article presents a new measure, the Exposure to Music in Childhood Inventory, for capturing the amount and type of exposure to music activities suitable for use with children. Children from public and private school, aged 5 to 13 years old (N = 1006; M = 8.36 years old, SD = 1.5 years) completed the inventory, and through a combination of exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis a two-factor solution was obtained.

However, we still lack a significant body of empirical studies examining the ways in which specific structural characteristics of music may alter the affective processing of visual information. The present study suggests a way to use algorithmically generated music to assess the effect of sensory dissonance on the emotional judgment of a visual scene. This was examined by presenting participants with the same abstract animated film paired with consonant, dissonant and no music. The level of sensory dissonance was controlled in this experiment by employing different interval sets for the two contrasting background music conditions. Immediately after viewing the clip, participants were asked to complete a series of bipolar adjective ratings representing the three connotative dimensions (valence, activity and potency). Results revealed that relative to the control group of no music, consonant background music significantly biased the affective impact by guiding participants toward positive valence ratings. This finding is discussed in terms of interval content theory within the general per-spective of post-tonal music theory and David Temperley's probabilistic framework (model of tonalness).},

	abstract = {From a cognitive standpoint, the analysis of music in audiovisual contexts presents a helpful field in which to explore the links between musical structure and emotional response. This work emerges from an empirical study that shows strong evidence in support of the effect of tonal dissonance level on interpretations regarding the emotional content of visual information. From this starting point it progresses toward the design of interactive multi-media tools aimed at investigating the various ways in which music may shape the semantic processing of visual contexts. A pilot experiment (work in pro-gress) using these tools to study the emotional effects of sensory dissonance is briefly described. 1 Introduction and Background Although research in music cognition has been growing steadily during the past four decades, we still lack a significant body of empirical studies concerning the higher levels of musical response, including the emotional and aesthetic aspects. From a cognitive standpoint, the analysis of music in audiovisual contexts presents a helpful field in which to explore the affective and connotative aspects of musical information [1, 2, 3]. This paper describes work in progress to investigate the influence of tonal disso-nance on the emotional interpretation of visual information. The objectives of this paper are: • To report on a formal experiment showing the effect of tonal dissonance on inter-pretations regarding the emotional content of an animated short film (Section 2). • To describe a series of interactive multimedia tools designed to investigate the various ways in which music may shape the semantic processing of visual contexts (Section 3).},

We show that over the course of iterated reproduction of two-dimensional random dot patterns transmission accuracy increased to a similar extent in 5- to 8-year-old children and adults whereas algorithmic complexity decreased faster in children. Thus, children require more structure to render complex inputs learnable. In line with the Less-Is-More hypothesis, we interpret this as evidence that children's processing limitations affecting working memory capacity and executive control constrain the ability to represent and generate complexity, which, in turn, facilitates emergence of structure. This underscores the importance of investigating the role of children in the transmission of complex cultural traits.},

Key signatures are modelled by signature vectors, i.e. seven-dimensional vectors with integer coordinates, each coordinate indicating the number of sharps (+) or flats (−) assigned to one of the seven letter names. A definition of standard signature vectors (those corresponding to the usual key signature of some major key) is readily formulated. These constructions do not depend on any convention regarding enharmonic equivalence of note names, but enharmonic equivalence (EE) conditions are intimately connected with key signatures, and in fact may also be formalized in terms of signature vectors, called in this context EE vectors. The canonical EE vector gives rise to a familiar twelve-note enharmonic system, but other systems are possible. Connections with maximal evenness and other properties familiar in diatonic set theory are investigated. The usual staff notation, inc...},

The method consists of generating all potential solutions containing all possible spellings for the pitch classes in a given input sequence, and subjecting them to five filtering stages to find the correct solution. We present an algorithm to accomplish this task, and demonstrate some exemplary outputs. Constructing also a modified version of the algorithm to retrieve and execute all possible input sequences, we also present distributions of various outcomes of the procedure over the input universe to exhibit an overall view of results to be produced by the algorithm, along with some findings obtained by this process.},

	abstract = {Mathematical approaches to music theory provide important insights into musical structures. Despite this progress, there is at present no unified mathematical framework. The aim of this article is to present a joint model of two of these approaches, namely scale theory and geometric approaches to harmony and voice leading. We generalize Richard Cohn's voice-leading efficiency [Cohn, Richard. 1996. "Maximally smooth cycles, hexatonic systems, and the analysis of late-romantic triadic progressions." Music Analysis 15 (1): 9-40] to a mathematical metric and investigate its properties with regard to the symmetrical set difference and the complement mapping. The voice-leading duality of complementary chords illustrates the usefulness of the model. This new fundamental principle states that certain minimal ascending voice leadings between two chords induce minimal descending voice leadings, with equal size, between their complementary chords. Consequently, this mathematical theorem explains the voice-leading duality between diatonic triads and seventh chords, and provides a novel approach to interpret the hexatonic pole from a voice-leading efficiency point of view.},

The previous findings are reconsidered using non-Western listeners (traditional healers from South Africa) in a modeling investigation. Comparison of different models made it possible to separate the role of data-driven and schema-driven models in melodic expectancies and to reveal any possible Western bias in previous studies. The results of the experiment, in which African listeners rated the fitness of probe-tones as continuations of North Sami yoik excerpts, indicated that data-driven models are adequate in explaining the expectancies, regardless of the cultural background of the listeners. The frequency-based models exerted more influence on listeners unfamiliar with the yoik style, the Western schematic model had most impact on Western listeners, and the style-specific models carried most predictive power for those listeners who possessed knowledge about yoiks. © 2009 by ESCOM European Society for the Cognitive Sciences of Music.},

Although this tendency is often attributed to listeners' expectations, it might arise more simply from constraints on melodic ranginess or tessitura. Skips tend toward the extremes of a melody's tessitura, and from those extremes a melody has little choice but to retreat by changing direction. Statistical analyses of vocal melodies from four different continents are consistent with this simple explanation. The results suggest that, in the sampled repertoires, patterns such as "gap-fill," "registral direction," and "registral return" (L. Meyer, 1956, 1973; E. Narmour, 1990) are mere side effects of constraints on melodic tessitura.},

These statistics, called expectancies, are found in music perception, and they span a variety of different features and time scales. Specifically, there is evidence that music perception involves strong expectancies regarding the distribution of a melodic interval, namely, the distance between two consecutive notes within the context of another. The recent availability of a large Western music dataset, consisting of the historical record condensed as melodic interval counts, has opened new possibilities for data-driven analysis of musical perception. In this context, we present an analytical approach that, based on cognitive theories of music expectation and machine learning techniques, recovers a set of factors that accurately identifies historical trends and stylistic transitions between the Baroque, Classical, Romantic, and Post-Romantic periods. We also offer a plausible musicological and cognitive interpretation of these factors, allowing us to propose them as data-driven principles of melodic expectation.},

We describe the nature of the statistical test as it is realized with a vector retrieval methodology based on the cosine coefficient of document-document similarity. As an example, this tech nique is then applied to a large MEDLINE " subset in the area of biotechnology. The initial processing of this datahase involves a 310 word stop list of common non-content terms. Our technique is then applied and 75\% of the remaining terms are identified as stop words. We compare retrieval with and without the removal of these stop words and find that of the top twenty documents retrieved in response to a random query document. seventeen of these are the same on the average for the two methods We also examine the differences and conclude that where the user prefers one method over the other, the new method with the reduced term set is favored about three times out of four.},

That means we’ve attempted to be ridiculously explicit in our exposition and notation. After providing the reasons and reasoning behind Gibbs sampling (and at least nodding our heads in the direction of theory), we work through two applications in detail. The first is the derivation of a Gibbs sampler for Naive Bayes models, which illustrates a simple case where the math works out very cleanly and it’s possible to “integrate out” the model’s continuous parameters to build a more efficient algorithm. The second application derives the Gibbs sampler for a model that is similar to Naive Bayes, but which adds an additional latent variable. Having gone through the two examples, we discuss some practical implementation issues. We conclude with some pointers to literature that we’ve found to be somewhat more friendly to uninitiated readers.},

	abstract = {© 2018 The New York Academy of Sciences. Music perception depends on internal psychological models derived through exposure to a musical culture. It is hypothesized that this musical enculturation depends on two cognitive processes: (1) statistical learning, in which listeners acquire internal cognitive models of statistical regularities present in the music to which they are exposed; and (2) probabilistic prediction based on these learned models that enables listeners to organize and process their mental representations of music. To corroborate these hypotheses, I review research that uses a computational model of probabilistic prediction based on statistical learning (the information dynamics of music (IDyOM) model) to simulate data from empirical studies of human listeners. The results show that a broad range of psychological processes involved in music perception-expectation, emotion, memory, similarity, segmentation, and meter-can be understood in terms of a single, underlying process of probabilistic prediction using learned statistical models. Furthermore, IDyOM simulations of listeners from different musical cultures demonstrate that statistical learning can plausibly predict causal effects of differential cultural exposure to musical styles, providing a quantitative model of cultural distance. Understanding the neural basis of musical enculturation will benefit from close coordination between empirical neuroimaging and computational modeling of underlying mechanisms, as outlined here.},

Authentic and half cadences not only serve as structural cornerstones of tonal music, but are readily perceived by both expert and novice listeners. Yet it is unclear how untrained listeners, who have never studied harmonic theory, come to recognise cadential patterns that are most often codified as short series of chords, such as V7–I or ii6–V. This study addresses both questions by analysing a corpus of string-quartet excerpts whose authentic and half cadences were identified by two musical experts. A cognitively plausible model of harmonic learning, which is based on clusters of scale-degree distributions abstracted from the data, is proposed. After assessing the correlation of this model’s output with cadential categories, Bayesian or near-Bayesian frameworks are used to learn these categories from the model in both supervised and unsupervised contexts. The model succeeds in not only spotting cadences but also identifying cadential categories from unlabelled data. The model’s relationship to relevant perceptual research, as well as the results’ implications for human learning and detection of cadences, is discussed.},

	abstract = {Possibilities and limitations of the digital data universe Digitization of cultural heritage over last 20 years has opened up very interesting possibil-ities for the study of our cultural past using computational " big data " methods. Today, as over two billion people create global " digital culture " by sharing their photos, video, links, writing posts, comments, ratings, etc., we can also use the same methods to study this universe of contemporary digital culture. In this chapter I will discuss a number of issues regarding the " shape " of the digital visual collections we have, from the point of view of researchers who use computational methods. They are working today in many fields including computer science, computational sociology, digital art history, digital humanities, digital heritage and Cultural Analytics – which is the term I introduced in 2007 to refer to all of this research, and also to a particular research program of our own lab that has focused on exploring large visual collections. Regardless of what analytical methods are used in this research, the analysis has to start with some concrete existing data. The " shapes " of existing digital collections may enable some research directions and make others more difficult. So what is the data universe cre-ated by digitization, what does it make possible, and also impossible? The Islands and The Ocean Before born-digital content, media creators first used physical and later electronic media (video and audio).

An empirical comparison of rhythm in language and music. Cognition, 87, B35–B45). The present experiments aimed to determine whether listeners actually perceive such rhythmic differences in a purely musical context (i.e., in instrumental music without words). In Experiment 1a, listeners successfully classified instrumental renditions of French and English songs having highly contrastive rhythmic differences. Experiment 1b replicated this result with the same songs containing rhythmic information only. In Experiments 2a and 2b, listeners successfully classified original and rhythm-only stimuli when language-specific rhythmic differences were less contrastive but more representative of differences found in actual music and speech. These findings indicate that listeners can use rhythmic similarities and differences to classify songs originally composed in two languages having contrasting rhythmic prosody.},

	volume = {1},
	abstract = {A random sample of 98 Gregorian chants was used to assemble " mode profiles " —pitch-class distributions for each of eight medieval modes in the manner of Krumhansl's and Kessler's (1982) key profiles. These profiles are shown to be useful in predicting the conventional modal designation for individual chants. An analysis of the eight mode profiles suggests that modes 3, 5 and 8 (Phrygian, Lydian and Hy-pomixolydian) are highly similar and can be distinguished from a more heterogeneous group consisting of the remaining modes. A cluster analysis of profiles for individual chants gives further evidence that these three modes form a supramodal category. The results are shown to be consistent with a theory of mode offered by the 11th-century writer, Johannes Cotto, who proposed that the tenor pitch is important in classifying modes. It is suggested that an observed polarization of the eight modes into two broad groups may have provided a cognitive kernel that facilitated the emergence of the ma-jor/minor system in the 17th century. THE subject of mode is among the most venerable topics in historical music scholarship. At the same time, the subject of tonality has proved to be one of the most active areas of research in the field of music perception and cognition. In this study, we will endeavor to link together these disparate areas of scholar-ship and apply a cognitively inspired approach to the study of mode. More specifically, we propose to ap-ply the principles of structural tonality to an analysis of the interrelationships among the modes of the me-dieval eight-fold system. Readers will likely be better versed in one or the other of these scholarly fields, so our study will begin by providing summary background information concerning modal theory and structural tonality. From this background we will formulate our principal hypothesis, assemble a test sample of music, and conduct a number of statistical analyses inspired by research in structural tonality. To anticipate our re-sults, our analyses will suggest that some modes resemble each other in ways that music psychologists con-sider cognitively important. At the outset it is important to understand that we will not make any claims about how medieval listeners perceived the various modes. Moreover, the research reported here relies on a number of assump-tions, any one of which may render the approach misguided. Nevertheless, in applying experimentally es-tablished principles in music perception and cognition, it is possible to infer aspects of modal organization that may have been sources of perceptual ambiguity for medieval listeners.},

Unlike previous efforts in the literature, the proposed representation is not dependent on the different spectral characteristics of different musical instruments and the accurate location of note onsets and offsets. This is achieved by first mapping the short term frequency spectrum of consecutive audio frames to the musical space (The Spiral Array) and defining a tonal identity with respect to center of effect that is generated by the spectral weights of the musical notes. We then use the resulting single dimensional text representations of the audio to create n-gram statistical sequence models to track the tonal characteristics and the behavior of the pieces. After performing appropriate smoothing, we build a collection of melodic n-gram models for testing. Using perplexity-based scoring, we test the likelihood of a sequence of lexical chords (an audio query) given each model in the database collection. Initial results show that, some variations of the input piece appears in the top 5 results 81\% of the time for whole melody inputs within a 500 polyphonic melody database. We also tested the retrieval engine for small audio clips. Using 25s segments, variations of the input piece are among the top 5 results 75\% of the time.},

To tackle a new application, a researcher typically tries to map their problem onto one of these existing methods, often influenced by their familiarity with specific algorithms and by the availability of corresponding software implementations. In this study, we describe an alternative methodology for applying machine learning, in which a bespoke solution is formulated for each new application. The solution is expressed through a compact modelling language, and the corresponding custom machine learning code is then generated automatically. This model-based approach offers several major advantages, including the opportunity to create highly tailored models for specific scenarios, as well as rapid prototyping and comparison of a range of alternative models. Furthermore, newcomers to the field of machine learning do not have to learn about the huge range of traditional methods, but instead can focus their attention on understanding a single modelling environment. In this study, we show how probabilistic graphical models, coupled with efficient inference algorithms, provide a very flexible foundation for model-based machine learning, and we outline a large-scale commercial application of this framework involving tens of millions of users. We also describe the concept of probabilistic programming as a powerful software environment for model-based machine learning, and we discuss a specific probabilistic programming language called Infer.NET, which has been widely used in practical applications.},

However, Bayes, in his theorem, used uniform priors [1]. Pierre-Simon Laplace (1749–1827), shown in the lower right corner of Figure 1, apparently unaware of Bayes' work, dis-covered the same theorem in more general form in a memoir he wrote at the age of 25 and showed its wide applicability [2]. Regarding these issues S.M. Stiegler writes: The influence of this memoir was immense. It was from here that " Bayesian " ideas first spread through the mathematical world, as Bayes's own article was ignored until 1780 and played no important role in scientific debate until the 20th century. It was also this article of Laplace's that introduced the mathematical techniques for the asymptotic analysis of poste-rior distributions that are still employed today. And it was here that the earliest example of optimum estimation can be found, the deriva-tion and characterization of an estimator that minimized a particular measure of posterior expected loss. After more than two centuries, we mathematicians, statisticians cannot only recognize our roots in this masterpiece of our science, we can still learn from it.

IEEE SIGNAL PROCESSING MAGAZINE [132] NOVEMBER 2008 IEEE SIGNAL PROCESSING MAGAZINE [132] NOVEMBER 2008 Maximum likelihood (ML) estimation is one of the most popular methodologies used in modern statistical signal pro-cessing. The expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is an iterative algorithm for ML estimation that has a number of advantages and has become a standard methodology for solv-ing statistical signal processing problems. However, the EM algorithm has certain requirements that seriously limit its applicability to complex problems. Recently, a new methodol-ogy termed " variational Bayesian inference " has emerged, which relaxes some of the limiting requirements of the EM algorithm and is gaining rapidly popularity. Furthermore, one can show that the EM algorithm can be viewed as a special case of this methodology. In this article, we first present a tutorial introduction of Bayesian variational inference aimed at the signal processing community. We use linear regression and Gaussian mixture modeling as examples to demonstrate the additional capabilities that Bayesian variational inference offers as compared to the EM algorithm.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an object lesson in the challenges and considerations involved in assembling a musical corpus for empirical research. It develops a model for the construction of a representative corpus of classical music of the “common practice period” (1700-1900), using both specific composers as well as broader historical styles and musical genres (e.g., symphony, chamber music, songs, operas) as its sampling parameters. Five sources were used in the construction of the model: (a) The Oxford History of Western Music by Richard Taruskin (2005), (b) amalgamated Orchestral Repertoire Reports for the years 2000-2007, from the League of American Orchestras, (c) a list of titles from the Naxos.com “Music in the Movies” web-based library, (d) Barlow and Morgenstern’s Dictionary of Musical Themes (1948), and (e) for the composers listed in sources (a)-(d), counts of the number of recordings each has available from Amazon.com. General considerations for these sources are discussed, and specific aspects of each source are then detailed. Intersource agreement is assessed, showing strong consensus among all sources, save for the Taruskin History. Using the Amazon.com data to determine weighting factors for each parameter, a preliminary sampling model is proposed. Including adequate genre representation leads to a corpus of ≈300 pieces, suggestive of the minimum size for an adequately representative corpus of classical music. The approaches detailed here may be applied to more specialized contexts, such as the music of a particular geographic region, historical era, or genre.},

	abstract = {Music is a fascinating topic for evolutionary theory, natural philosophy, and narrative construction: music is a highly valued feature of all known living cultures, pervading many aspects of daily life, playing many roles. And music is ancient. The oldest known musical instruments appear in the archaeological record from 40,000 years ago (40 Kya) and from these we can infer even earlier musical artefacts/activities, as yet unrepresented in the archaeological record. I argue that, following research couched in the social brain hypothesis framework, a theoretical basis is emerging for the proposition that the (incremental) evolution of proto-music took hold in the late mid-Pleistocene, roughly 400 Kya, and perhaps earlier. Subsequently, musical activities and traditions incrementally evolved throughout modernity (from 250 Kya onwards), global dispersal from Africa (currently thought to be from 60-100 Kya onwards), and the Holocene (from 12 Kya).

	doi = {10.1038/srep00521},
	abstract = {Popular music is a key cultural expression that has captured listeners' attention for ages. Many of the structural regularities underlying musical discourse are yet to be discovered and, accordingly, their historical evolution remains formally unknown. Here we unveil a number of patterns and metrics characterizing the generic usage of primary musical facets such as pitch, timbre, and loudness in contemporary western popular music. Many of these patterns and metrics have been consistently stable for a period of more than fifty years. However, we prove important changes or trends related to the restriction of pitch transitions, the homogenization of the timbral palette, and the growing loudness levels. This suggests that our perception of the new would be rooted on these changing characteristics. Hence, an old tune could perfectly sound novel and fashionable, provided that it consisted of common harmonic progressions, changed the instrumentation, and increased the average loudness. I sn't it always the same? This question could be easily posed while listening to the music of any mainstream radio station in a western country. Like language, music is a human universal involving perceptually discrete elements displaying organization 1 . Therefore, contemporary popular music may have a well-established set of underlying patterns and regularities 1–4 , some of them potentially inherited from the classical tradition 5–7 . Yet, as an incomparable artistic product for conveying emotions 8 , music must incorporate variation over such patterns in order to play upon people's memories and expectations, making it attractive to listeners 3–5 . For the very same reasons, long-term variations of the underlying patterns may also occur across years 9 . Many of these aspects remain formally unknown or lack scientific evidence, specially the latter, which is very often neglected in music-related studies, from musicological analyses to technological applications. The study of patterns and long-term variations in popular music could shed new light on relevant issues concerning its organization, structure, and dynamics 10 . More importantly, it addresses valuable questions for the basic understanding of music as one of the main expressions of contemporary culture: Can we identify some of the patterns behind music creation? Do musicians change them over the years? Can we spot differences between new and old music? Is there an 'evolution' of musical discourse? Current technologies for music information processing 11,12 provide a unique opportunity to answer the above questions under objective, empirical, and quantitative premises. Moreover, akin to recent advances in other cultural assets 13},

The technique is a variation of Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (Hinton and Roweis, 2002) that is much easier to optimize, and produces significantly better visualizations by reducing the tendency to crowd points together in the center of the map. t-SNE is better than existing techniques at creating a single map that reveals structure at many different scales. This is particularly important for high-dimensional data that lie on several different, but related, low-dimensional manifolds, such as images of objects from multiple classes seen from multiple viewpoints. For visualizing the structure of very large data sets, we show how t-SNE can use random walks on neighborhood graphs to allow the implicit structure of all of the data to influence the way in which a subset of the data is displayed. We illustrate the performance of t-SNE on a wide variety of data sets and compare it with many other non-parametric visualization techniques, including Sammon mapping, Isomap, and Locally Linear Embedding. The visualiza-tions produced by t-SNE are significantly better than those produced by the other techniques on almost all of the data sets.},

	abstract = {THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE HISTORICAL DEVELOP-ment of common-practice musical style and how that development might connect to the cognition of key within the history of Western European tonality. First, musical corpora of 19 composers were divided into three-chord progressions, and these progressions were tallied. The chord tallies were used for a cluster analysis and for measurements of inter-corpus cross entropy. The cluster analysis divided the corpora in ways that conform to historical and stylistic intuitions, and inter-corpus cross entropy was found to correlate with the years separating the corpora. These findings show that the chronological distance between two musical corpora seems to predict compositional similarity and that chord-progression norms are connected to specific historical situations. In order to model how these changes might affect the cognition of musical key, a cor-pus-sensitive key-finding algorithm was used to decode key within a famous example of musical ambiguity, the opening of Beethoven's ''Eroica'' symphony. Each corpus-trained model created a slightly different key interpretation, suggesting that historically situated models of tonal cognition might indeed interpret the same stimulus differently.},

This study provides a) an external validation of the accuracy rates of that algorithm on an independent dataset, and b) a validation of that dataset using the algorithm. Specifically, a large dataset of over 12,000 MIDI works found on ClassicalArchives.com were sampled for this purpose. MIDI data tends to contain a high percentage of errors. To determine whether the database provides a sufficient signal to noise ratio for pitch-reliant tasks like key-finding, an initial validation study was performed on the dataset in which accuracy rates for the key-finding algorithm on a small subset of 32 works were compared with a ground truth of accuracy rates. In the initial study, it was found that 28 of 32 (87.5\%) of MIDI works returned the same result as the ground truth. Given this relatively high accuracy rate, it was determined that the database can be an appropriate vehicle for testing a key finding algorithm. On a dataset of 192 separate works, it was found that the algorithm correctly assigned keys to 164 works (85.4\%). Together, the two studies are consistent with the ideas that, 1) though there will be some errors as a result of noisy data, a MIDI database can serve some uses for some studies, and 2) the key finding meta-algorithm provides an accurate way to assign keys to this database.},

Furthermore, it was examined whether including different melodic accent types would improve the classification performance. By determining the components of the autocorrelation functions that were significant in the classification it was found that periodicity in note onset locations was the most important cue for the determination of meter. Of the melodic accents included, Thomassen's melodic accent was found to provide the most reliable cues for the determination of meter. The discriminant function analyses suggested that periodicities longer than one measure may provide cues for meter determination that are more reliable than shorter periodicities. Overall, the method predicted notated meter with an accuracy reaching 96\% for binary classification and 75\% for classification into nine categories of meter.},

We further distinguish these notions from "specialisation," "degree of detail," "density," and "connectivity." We argue that the notion of "collectivity"-molecules in water, cells in tissues, people in crowds, stars in galaxies-has been neglected but is a key to representing biological notions, that it is a pervasive notion across size ranges-micro, macro, cosmological, etc.-and that it provides an account of a number of troublesome issues including the most important cases of when the biomedical notion of parthood is, or is not, best represented by a transitive relation.

It has been shown before that pitch class sets can be divided into six different categories. Each category inher-its a typical character which can " tell " something about the music in which it appears. In this paper we explore the pos-sibilities of using pitch class set categories for 1) classifica-tion in major/minor mode, 2) classification in tonal/atonal music, 3) determination of a degree of tonality, and 4) de-termination of a composer's period.},

	abstract = {We present a novel approach to clustering and classification of music, based on the concept of interval categories. Six interval cate-gories exist, each with its own musical character. A piece of music can be represented by six numbers, reflecting the percentages of occurrences of each interval category. A piece of music can, in this way, be visualized as a point in a six dimensional space. The three most significant dimen-sions are chosen from these six. Using this approach, a successful visual clustering of music is possible for 1) composers through various musical time periods, and 2) the three periods of Beethoven, which illustrates the use of our approach on both a general and a specific level. Furthermore, we will see that automatic classification between tonal and atonal music can be achieved.},

The present paper purports to show that magnitudes of Fourier coef-ficients, or 'saliency' as introduced by Ian Quinn in [9], provide better measurements of diatonicity, chromaticity, octatonicity. . .

	abstract = {We propose a standard representation for hierarchical musical analyses as an extension to the Music Encoding Initiative (MEI) representation for music. Analyses of music need to be represented in digital form for the same reasons as music: preservation, sharing of data, data linking, and digital processing. Systems exist for representing sequential information, but many music analyses are hierarchical, whether represented explicitly in trees or graphs or not. Features of MEI allow the representation of an analysis to be directly associated with the elements of the music analyzed. MEI's basis in TEI (Text Encoding Initiative), allows us to design a scheme which reuses some of the elements of TEI for the representation of trees and graphs. In order to capture both the information specific to a type of music analysis and the underlying form of an analysis as a tree or graph, we propose related "semantic" encodings, which capture the detailed information, and generic "non-semantic" encodings which expose the tree or graph structure. We illustrate this with examples of representations of a range of different kinds of analysis.},

	abstract = {The availability of large diachronic corpora has provided the impetus for a growing body of quantitative research on language evolution and meaning change. The central quantities in this research are token frequencies of linguistic elements in the texts, with changes in frequency taken to reflect the popularity or selective fitness of an element. However, corpus frequencies may change for a wide variety of reasons, including purely random sampling effects, or because corpora are composed of contemporary media and fiction texts within which the underlying topics ebb and flow with cultural and socio-political trends. In this work, we introduce a computationally simple model for controlling for topical fluctuations in corpora - the topical-cultural advection model - and demonstrate how it provides a robust baseline of variability in word frequency changes over time. We validate the model on a diachronic corpus spanning two centuries, and a carefully-controlled artificial language change scenario, and then use it to correct for topical fluctuations in historical time series. Finally, we show that the model can be used to show that emergence of new words typically corresponds with the rise of a trending topic. This suggests that some lexical innovations occur due to growing communicative need in a subspace of the lexicon, and that the topical-cultural advection model can be used to quantify this.},

This article proposes a theoretical framework to further investigate Liszt’s intuitions in light of contemporary research on musical meaning and communication. First, we analyze philological data concerning Liszt’s creative process in the Mazeppa works, a set of works including both his virtuoso and program music.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a condition characterized by the gradual loss of kidney function over time. Self-management programs have been widely applied to chronic disease education programs, which are designed to delay deteriorating kidney functions, preclude depression, and improve quality of life. This study aims to analyze effectiveness of self-management programs in bettering CKD patients' eGFR, mitigating depression symptoms and improving quality of life in randomized control or clinical trials. METHODS: Using key terms, a search was conducted in English-language, peer-reviewed journals on CKD that were published between 2002 and 2014 on databases including CINAHL, Cochrane Library, MEDLINE. The measurable variables included CKD patients' eGFR, depression, and quality of life. Random and fixed effects meta analysis were applied with standard error and correlation based measure of effect size. RESULTS: Eight studies met the inclusion criteria. A self-management program significantly impacted CKD patients' depression and mental quality-of-life dimensions, with an effect size of .29 [95\% confidence interval (CI) (0.07, 0.53)] and -.42 [95\% CI (-0.75, -0.10)]. However, the intervention of a self-management program had no significant effect on patients' eGFR as well as physical quality-of-life dimensions, with effect sizes of .06 [95\% CI (-0.69, 0.81)] and -.16 [95\% CI (-0.81, 0.50)]. CONCLUSIONS: Self-management programs of patients with chronic kidney disease can improve the depression and mental quality of life. Aside from providing more objective evidence-based results, this study provides a reference for clinical health care personnel who tend to patients with CKD.},

	abstract = {This article examines some manifestations of Zipf's Law in music. This law describes the frequency of occurrence of events within a phenomenon. This article proposes the use of Zipf-based metrics as a basis for author- and style-identification tasks and for the assessment of aesthetic properties of music pieces. The experimental results in author-identification tasks, where an average success rate of more than 94 percent was attained, show that the used set of metrics, and accordingly Zipf's Law, capture meaningful information about the music pieces. Clearly, the success of this approach does not imply that other metrics or approaches are irrelevant. As noticed by several researchers, culturally sanctioned music tends to exhibit near-ideal Zipf distributions across various parameters. This suggests the possibility that combinations of Zipf-based metrics may represent certain necessary but not sufficient conditions for aesthetically pleasing music. This is supported by our pleasantness study where an artificial neural network (ANN) succeeds in predicting human aesthetic judgments of unknown pieces with more than 98 percent accuracy. It should be emphasized that the metrics proposed in this article offer a particular description of the musical pieces, where traditional musical structures such as motives, tonal structures, etc., are not measured explicitly. Statistical measurements, such as Zipf's Law, tend to focus on general trends and thus can miss significant details.},

	abstract = {Power-law distributions occur in many situations of scientific interest and have significant consequences for our understanding of natural and man-made phenomena. Unfortunately, the detection and characterization of power laws is complicated by the large fluctuations that occur in the tail of the distribution-the part of the distribution representing large but rare events-and by the difficulty of identifying the range over which power-law behavior holds. Commonly used methods for analyzing power-law data, such as least-squares fitting, can produce substantially inaccurate estimates of parameters for power-law distributions, and even in cases where such methods return accurate answers they are still unsatisfactory because they give no indication of whether the data obey a power law at all. Here we present a principled statistical framework for discerning and quantifying power-law behavior in empirical data. Our approach combines maximum-likelihood fitting methods with goodness-of-fit tests based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic and likelihood ratios. We evaluate the effectiveness of the approach with tests on synthetic data and give critical comparisons to previous approaches. We also apply the proposed methods to twenty-four real-world data sets from a range of different disciplines, each of which has been conjectured to follow a power-law distribution. In some cases we find these conjectures to be consistent with the data while in others the power law is ruled out.},

(Rimas NorvaiAa, Mathematical Reviews, Issue 2007 f) Product Description This is a graduate level textbook on measure theory and probability theory. The book can be used as a text for a two semester sequence of courses in measure theory and probability theory, with an option to include supplemental material on stochastic processes and special topics. It is intended primarily for first year Ph.D. students in mathematics and statistics although mathematically advanced students from engineering and economics would also find the book useful. Prerequisites are kept to the minimal level of an understanding of basic real analysis concepts such as limits, continuity, differentiability, Riemann integration, and convergence of sequences and series. A review of this material is included in the appendix. The book starts with an informal introduction that provides some heuristics into the abstract concepts of measure and integration theory, which are then rigorously developed. The first part of the book can be used for a standard real analysis course for both mathematics and statistics Ph.D. students as it provides full coverage of topics such as the construction of Lebesgue-Stieltjes measures on real line and Euclidean spaces, the basic convergence theorems, L p spaces, signed measures, Radon-Nikodym theorem, Lebesgue's decomposition theorem and the fundamental theorem of Lebesgue integration on R, product spaces and product measures, and Fubini-Tonelli theorems. It also provides an elementary introduction to Banach and Hilbert spaces, convolutions, Fourier series and Fourier and Plancherel transforms. Thus part I would be particularly useful for students in a typical Statistics Ph.D. program if a separate course on real analysis is not a standard requirement. Part II (chapters 6-13) provides full coverage of standard graduate level probability theory. It starts with Kolmogorov's probability model and Kolmogorov's existence theorem. It then treats thoroughly the laws of large numbers including renewal theory and ergodic theorems with applications and then weak convergence of probability distributions, characteristic functions, the Levy-Cramer continuity theorem and the central limit theorem as well as stable laws. It ends with conditional expectations and conditional probability, and an introduction to the theory of discrete time martingales. Part III (chapters 14-18) provides a modest coverage of discrete time Markov chains with countable and general state spaces, MCMC, continuous time discrete space jump Markov processes, Brownian motion, mixing sequences, bootstrap methods, and branching processes. It could be used for a topics/seminar course or as an introduction to stochastic processes.

	abstract = {The creation of enormous and inclusive databases, the digitization of literary works, and the steady improvement in search engines enable scholars in the digital humanities to ask very big questions. Using computational analysis to retrieve key words, phrases, and linguistic patterns across thousands of texts in digital libraries, researchers can draw conclusions based on quantifiable evidence regarding how literary trends are employed over time, across periods, within regions, or within demographic groups, as well as how cultural, historical, and societal linkages may bind individual authors, texts, and genres into an aggregate literary culture. In this volume, Matthew L. Jockers introduces readers to large-scale literary computing and the revolutionary potential of macroanalysis--a new approach to the study of the literary record designed for probing the digital-textual world as it exists today, in digital form and in large quantities. Moving beyond the limitations of literary interpretation based on the "close-reading" of individual works, Jockers describes how this new method of studying large collections of digital material can help us to better understand and contextualize the individual works within those collections.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Zipf's law and Heaps' law are observed in disparate complex systems. Of particular interests, these two laws often appear together. Many theoretical models and analyses are performed to understand their co-occurrence in real systems, but it still lacks a clear picture about their relation. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS We show that the Heaps' law can be considered as a derivative phenomenon if the system obeys the Zipf's law. Furthermore, we refine the known approximate solution of the Heaps' exponent provided the Zipf's exponent. We show that the approximate solution is indeed an asymptotic solution for infinite systems, while in the finite-size system the Heaps' exponent is sensitive to the system size. Extensive empirical analysis on tens of disparate systems demonstrates that our refined results can better capture the relation between the Zipf's and Heaps' exponents. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE The present analysis provides a clear picture about the relation between the Zipf's law and Heaps' law without the help of any specific stochastic model, namely the Heaps' law is indeed a derivative phenomenon from the Zipf's law. The presented numerical method gives considerably better estimation of the Heaps' exponent given the Zipf's exponent and the system size. Our analysis provides some insights and implications of real complex systems. For example, one can naturally obtained a better explanation of the accelerated growth of scale-free networks.},

This process of categorisation is formalised as the mapping from the continuous space of a series of time intervals to a discrete, symbolic domain of integer-ratio sequences. The methodological framework uses concepts from mathematics and psychology (eg convexity and entropy) that allow precise characterisations of the empirical results.In the first experiment, twenty-nine participants performed an identification task with 66 rhythmic stimuli (a systematic sampling of the performance space).

	abstract = {In modern societies, cultural change seems ceaseless. The flux of fashion is especially obvious for popular music. While much has been written about the origin and evolution of pop, most claims about its history are anecdotal rather than scientific in nature. To rectify this, we investigate the US Billboard Hot 100 between 1960 and 2010. Using music information retrieval and text-mining tools, we analyse the musical properties of approximately 17 000 recordings that appeared in the charts and demonstrate quantitative trends in their harmonic and timbral properties. We then use these properties to produce an audio-based classification of musical styles and study the evolution of musical diversity and disparity, testing, and rejecting, several classical theories of cultural change. Finally, we investigate whether pop musical evolution has been gradual or punctuated. We show that, although pop music has evolved continuously, it did so with particular rapidity during three stylistic ‘revolutions’ around 1964, 1983 and 1991. We conclude by discussing how our study points the way to a quantitative science of cultural change.},

	abstract = {Music exhibits structure at multiple scales, ranging from motifs to large-scale functional components. When inferring the structure of a piece, different listeners may attend to different temporal scales, which can result in disagreements when they describe the same piece. In the field of music informatics research (MIR), it is common to use corpora annotated with structural boundaries at different levels. By quantifying disagreements between multiple annotators, previous research has yielded several insights relevant to the study of music cognition. First, annotators tend to agree when structural boundaries are ambiguous. Second, this ambiguity seems to depend on musical features, time scale, and genre. Furthermore, it is possible to tune current annotation evaluation metrics to better align with these perceptual differences. However, previous work has not directly analyzed the effects of hierarchical structure because the existing methods for comparing structural annotations are designed for "flat" descriptions, and do not readily generalize to hierarchical annotations. In this paper, we extend and generalize previous work on the evaluation of hierarchical descriptions of musical structure. We derive an evaluation metric which can compare hierarchical annotations holistically across multiple levels. sing this metric, we investigate inter-annotator agreement on the multilevel annotations of two different music corpora, investigate the influence of acoustic properties on hierarchical annotations, and evaluate existing hierarchical segmentation algorithms against the distribution of inter-annotator agreement.},

Vivaldi, who almost invariably placed his arias in a contrasting key, was a leading exponent of this technique and employed a surprisingly large variety of key relationships at the recitative–aria interface. For illustration, the article draws on cantatas by Vinaccesi, Albinoni and Vivaldi.},

	abstract = {Probability distributions over external states (priors) are essential to the interpretation of sensory signals. Priors for cultural artifacts such as music and language remain largely uncharacterized, but likely constrain cultural transmission, because only those signals with high probability under the prior can be reliably reproduced and communicated. We developed a method to estimate priors for simple rhythms via iterated reproduction of random temporal sequences. Listeners were asked to reproduce random "seed" rhythms; their reproductions were fed back as the stimulus and over time became dominated by internal biases, such that the prior could be estimated by applying the procedure multiple times. We validated that the measured prior was consistent across the modality of reproduction and that it correctly predicted perceptual discrimination. We then measured listeners' priors over the entire space of two- and three-interval rhythms. Priors in US participants showed peaks at rhythms with simple integer ratios and were similar for musicians and non-musicians. An analogous procedure produced qualitatively different results for spoken phrases, indicating some specificity to music. Priors measured in members of a native Amazonian society were distinct from those in US participants but also featured integer ratio peaks. The results do not preclude biological constraints favoring integer ratios, but they suggest that priors on musical rhythm are substantially modulated by experience and may simply reflect the empirical distribution of rhythm that listeners encounter. The proposed method can efficiently map out a high-resolution view of biases that shape transmission and stability of simple reproducible patterns within a culture.},

This article first shows that human language has a highly complex, reliable structure in the frequency distribution over and above this classic law, although prior data visualization methods have obscured this fact. A number of empirical phenomena related to word frequencies are then reviewed. These facts are chosen to be informative about the mechanisms giving rise to Zipf's law and are then used to evaluate many of the theoretical explanations of Zipf's law in language. No prior account straightforwardly explains all the basic facts or is supported with independent evaluation of its underlying assumptions. To make progress at understanding why language obeys Zipf's law, studies must seek evidence beyond the law itself, testing assumptions and evaluating novel predictions with new, independent data.},

It has been further argued that genre classification is of limited utility as a goal in itself because of the ambiguities and subjectivity inherent to genre. This paper presents a number of counterarguments that emphasize the importance of continuing research in automatic genre classification. Specific strategies for overcoming current performance limitations are discussed, and a brief review of background research in musicology and psychology relating to genre is presented. Insights from these highly relevant fields are generally absent from discourse within the MIR community, and it is hoped that this will help to encourage a more multidisciplinary approach to automatic genre classification in the future.},

In this paper we examine generalized interval systems, beginning with the definition, then exploring the ways they can be transformed, and finally explaining commonly used musical transformation techniques with ideas from group theory.

As collocations have found many applications in the fields of natural language processing, information retrieval, and text mining, extracting them from large corpora has been the focus of many studies over the past few years. In this paper, we introduce the notion of an extension pattern, a formalization of the idea of extending lexical association measures (AMs) defined for bigrams. An extension pattern provides a measure-independent way of extending AMs for extracting collocations of arbitrary length. We define different extension patterns and compare them on a task of extracting collocations from a newspaper corpus. We show that the stopword-sensitive extension patterns we propose outperform other extensions, which indicates that AMs could benefit by taking into account linguistic information about an n-gram's part-of-speech pattern.},

Second, we describe several classification methods for combining association measures , followed by their evaluation and comparison with individual measures. Finally , we propose a feature selection algorithm significantly reducing the number of combined measures with only a small performance degradation.},

	abstract = {Chord recognition systems typically comprise an acoustic model that predicts chords for each audio frame, and a temporal model that casts these predictions into labelled chord segments. However, temporal models have been shown to only smooth predictions, without being able to incorporate musical information about chord progressions. Recent research discovered that it might be the low hierarchical level such models have been applied to (directly on audio frames) which prevents learning musical relationships, even for expressive models such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs). However, if applied on the level of chord sequences, RNNs indeed can become powerful chord predictors. In this paper, we disentangle temporal models into a harmonic language model-to be applied on chord sequences-and a chord duration model that connects the chord-level predictions of the language model to the frame-level predictions of the acoustic model. In our experiments, we explore the impact of each model on the chord recognition score, and show that using harmonic language and duration models improves the results.},

I propose that mathematical modelling of certain kinds may be appropriate to model certain musical relationships, but this is so because of underlying cognitive princi- ples. The conclusion is that to model music mathematically is essentially to model (parts of) cognition mathematically, which means that to model music in the abstract, as though it were itself a mathematical construct, divorced from its source in the human mind, is misleading. For a true understanding, the power of mathematics should be applied to the process of musical behaviour, not merely to its product. That process lies in the embodied human mind. Keywords:},

	abstract = {In this paper we focus on issues of harmonic representa- tion and computational analysis. A new idiom- independent representation is proposed of chord types that is appropriate for encoding tone simultaneities in any harmonic context (such as tonal, modal, jazz, octatonic, atonal). The General Chord Type (GCT) representation, allows the re-arrangement of the notes of a harmonic simultaneity such that abstract idiom-specific types of chords may be derived; this encoding is inspired by the standard roman numeral chord type labeling, but is more general and flexible. Given a consonance-dissonance classification of intervals (that reflects culturally- dependent notions of consonance/dissonance), and a scale, the GCT algorithm finds the maximal subset of notes of a given note simultaneity that contains only con- sonant intervals; this maximal subset forms the base upon which the chord type is built. The proposed representa- tion is ideal for hierarchic harmonic systems such as the tonal system and its many variations, but adjusts to any other harmonic system such as post-tonal, atonal music, or traditional polyphonic systems. The GCT representa- tion is applied to a small set of examples from diverse musical idioms, and its output is illustrated and analysed showing its potential, especially, for computational music analysis \& music information retrieval.},

There are many sources too for basic information on the extensions to the WWW that permit content to be expressed in natural language yet used by software agents to easily find, share and integrate information. Until now individuals engaged in creating ontologies- formal descriptions of the concepts, terms, and relationships within a given knowledge domain- have had no sources beyond the technical standards documents. Semantic Web for the Working Ontologist transforms this information into the practical knowledge that programmers and subject domain experts need. Authors Allemang and Hendler begin with solutions to the basic problems, but don't stop there: they demonstrate how to develop your own solutions to problems of increasing complexity and ensure that your skills will keep pace with the continued evolution of the Semantic Web. Provides practical information for all programmers and subject matter experts engaged in modeling data to fit the requirements of the Semantic Web. De-emphasizes algorithms and proofs, focusing instead on real-world problems, creative solutions, and highly illustrative examples. Presents detailed, ready-to-apply recipes for use in many specific situations. Shows how to create new recipes from RDF, RDFS, and OWL constructs.},

A number of alternatives have been of- fered—most of which require the investigator to have strong, theoretically guided hypotheses, and presume that the data conform strictly to the demands of the design. The present article addresses the common situation in which data analysis is exploratory rather than hypothesis testing and in which the model is applied to data that only loosely meet the requirements of the design. In this case, aging, period, or cohort effects can be inferred if the researcher is willing to make appropriate restrictive assumptions and uses scientific judgment rather than fixed decision rules. The application of judgmental principles is illustrated on two longitudinal data sets, and it is argued that the analytic designs are useful if intelligently applied and interpreted.},

Our model is based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a statistical approach for discovering hidden topics in large corpora of text. In our adaptation of LDA, symbolic music files play the role of text documents, groups of musical notes play the role of words, and musical keyprofiles play the role of topics. The topics are discovered as significant, recurring distributions over twelve neutral pitch-classes. Though discovered automatically, these distributions closely resemble the traditional key-profiles used to indicate the stability and importance of neutral pitchclasses in the major and minor keys of western music. Unlike earlier approaches based on human judgement, our model learns key-profiles in an unsupervised manner, inferring them automatically from a large musical corpus that contains no key annotations. We show how these learned key-profiles can be used to determine the key of a musical piece and track its harmonic modulations. We also show how the models inferences can be used to compare musical pieces based on their harmonic structure.},

There are two cultures in the use of statistical modeling to reach conclusions from data. One assumes that the data are generated by a given stochastic data model. The other uses algorithmic models and treats the data mechanism as unknown. The statistical community has been committed to the almost exclusive use of data models. This commitment has led to irrelevant theory, questionable conclusions, and has kept statisticians from working on a large range of interesting current problems. Algorithmic modeling, both in theory and practice, has developed rapidly in fields outside statistics. It can be used both on large complex data sets and as a more accurate and informative alternative to data modeling on smaller data sets. If our goal as a field is to use data to solve problems, then we need to move away from exclusive dependence on data models and adopt a more diverse set of tools.},

Results: Needle aspiration significantly increased the sensitivity of bronchoscopy when added to convention-al methods (from 76 to 91\%; p {\textless} 0.001), primarily resulting from differences in submucosal/peribronchial diseases (68 vs. 90\%; p {\textless} 0.001) and independently from the presence of rapid on-site evaluation; needle aspiration guided by rapid on-site evaluation guaranteed a higher improvement in bronchoscopy sensitivity than conventional needle aspira-tion (98 vs. 84\%, respectively; p = 0.004). Needle aspiration guided by rapid on-site evaluation showed a significantly higher sensitivity than the conventional method (97 vs. 76\%, respectively; p = 0.001). Conclusions: Needle aspiration in-creases the sensitivity of bronchoscopy in diagnosing cen-tral airways malignancies when added to conventional diag-nostic methods, with a further significant improvement when guided by rapid on-site evaluation. Abstract Background: Few prospective studies have evaluated the role of endobronchial needle aspiration in diagnosing cen-tral airways neoplasms. Rapid on-site evaluation has long been used in transbronchial needle aspiration of adenopa-thies and peripheral lesions, but its role in sampling central malignancies has not been substantiated yet. Objectives: In this study we evaluated if endobronchial needle aspiration may increase the sensitivity of bronchoscopy for diagnosing central airways neoplasms when added to conventional di-agnostic methods (forceps biopsy, brushing and bronchial washing), and if rapid on-site evaluation may be beneficial in patients undergoing endobronchial needle aspiration. Methods: 125 patients (77\% males, aged 70 ± 7 years; mean ± SD) with central lung cancers were randomized to undergo bronchoscopy including conventional diagnostic methods},

	abstract = {The discovery of patterns using a minimal set of assumptions constitutes a central challenge in the modeling of polyphonic music and complex streams in general. Skip-grams have been found to be a powerful model for capturing semi-local dependencies in sequences of entities when dependencies may not be directly adjacent (see, for instance , the problems of modeling sequences of words or letters in computational linguistics). Since common skip-grams define locality based on indices, they can only be applied to a single stream of non-overlapping entities. This paper proposes a generalized skipgram model that allows arbitrary cost functions (defining locality), efficient filtering , recursive application (skipgrams over skipgrams), and memory efficient streaming. Further, a sampling mechanism is proposed that flexibly controls runtime and output size. These generalizations and optimizations make it possible to employ skipgrams for the discovery of repeated patterns of close, nonsimultaneous events or notes. The extensions to the skipgram model provided here do not only apply to musical notes but to any list of entities that is monotonic with respect to a given cost function.},

For instance, the distributions of the sizes of cities, earthquakes, solar flares, moon craters, wars and people's personal fortunes all appear to follow power laws. The origin of power-law behaviour has been a topic of debate in the scientific community for more than a century. Here we review some of the empirical evidence for the existence of power-law forms and the theories proposed to explain them.},

	title = {Scale-free networks are rare},
	abstract = {A central claim in modern network science is that real-world networks are typically "scale free," meaning that the fraction of nodes with degree k follows a power law, decaying like k −α , often with 2 {\textless} α {\textless} 3. However, empirical evidence for this belief derives from a relatively small number of real-world networks. We test the universality of scale-free structure by applying state-of-the-art statistical tools to a large corpus of nearly 1000 network data sets drawn from social, biological, technological, and informational sources. We fit the power-law model to each degree distribution, test its statistical plausibility, and compare it via a likelihood ratio test to alternative, non-scale-free models, e.g., the log-normal. Across domains, we find that scale-free networks are rare, with only 4\% exhibiting the strongest-possible evidence of scale-free structure and 52\% exhibiting the weakest-possible evidence. Furthermore, evidence of scale-free structure is not uniformly distributed across sources: social networks are at best weakly scale free, while a handful of technological and biological networks can be called strongly scale free. These results undermine the universality of scale-free networks and reveal that real-world networks exhibit a rich structural diversity that will likely require new ideas and mechanisms to explain. Networks are a powerful way to both represent and study the structure of complex systems of all kinds. Examples today are plentiful and include social interactions among individuals, both offline and online, protein or gene interactions in biological organisms, communication between digital computers, and various kinds of transportation networks. Across scientific domains and different types of networks, it is common to encounter the claim that most or all real-world networks are scale free. The precise details of this claim vary across the literature [1-7], but generally agree that a network is scale free if the fraction of nodes with degree k follows a power-law distribution k −α , where α {\textgreater} 1. Some versions of this "scale-free hypothesis" make the requirements stronger, e.g., requiring that α ∈ [2, 3] or that node degrees evolve by the preferential attachment mechanism [8, 9]. Other versions make them weaker, e.g., requiring that the power law holds only in the upper tail [10] or is merely more plausible than a thin-tailed distribution like an exponential or normal [11]. Despite the frequency of these claims, there has been no broad evaluation of the empirical prevalence of scale-free patterns in real-world networks. If networks are in fact universally scale free, then many theoretical results about scale-free networks have broad scientific relevance. For instance, the several mechanisms known to build scale-free networks [3, 8, 9, 12-16] would provide a common basis for understanding network assembly. And, such mechanisms could be used to create realistic synthetic networks for numerical simulations and experiments. Moreover, many studies have investigated how scale-free structure shapes the dynamics of processes run},

	abstract = {Power-law distributions occur in many situations of scientific interest and have significant consequences for our understanding of natural and man-made phenomena. Unfortunately, the detection and characterization of power laws is complicated by the large fluctuations that occur in the tail of the distribution-the part of the distribution representing large but rare events-and by the difficulty of identifying the range over which power-law behavior holds. Commonly used methods for analyzing power-law data, such as least-squares fitting, can produce substantially inaccurate estimates of parameters for power-law distributions , and even in cases where such methods return accurate answers they are still unsatisfactory because they give no indication of whether the data obey a power law at all. Here we present a principled statistical framework for discerning and quantifying power-law behavior in empirical data. Our approach combines maximum-likelihood fitting methods with goodness-of-fit tests based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistic and likelihood ratios. We evaluate the effectiveness of the approach with tests on synthetic data and give critical comparisons to previous approaches. We also apply the proposed methods to twenty-four real-world data sets from a range of different disciplines, each of which has been conjectured to follow a power-law distribution. In some cases we find these conjectures to be consistent with the data, while in others the power law is ruled out.},

Here, 'popular' does not only refer to the genre named MPB (Brazilian Popular Music) but to nine different genres that were considered particular to the Brazilian case. The main goals of the present work are to extract and engineer harmonically related features from chords data and to use it to classify popular Brazilian music genres towards establishing a connection between harmonic relationships and Brazilian genres. We also emphasize the generalisation of the method for obtaining the data, allowing for the replication and direct extension of this work. Our final model is a combination of multiple classification trees, also known as the random forest model. We found that features extracted from harmonic elements can satisfactorily predict music genre for the Brazilian case, as well as features obtained from the Spotify API.

[Patel and Daniele (2003a)][1] introduced the nPVI to music research and it has since been used in a number of studies. In this paper, I present a methodological criticism of the nPVI as applied to music. I discuss the known qualitative features of the nPVI and illustrate the nPVI's fundamental features and assumptions through its application to a number of musical datasets. My principle criticism regards the application of a linear average (the nPVI) to categorical data (rhythmic notation). I argue that that simpler mathematical characterizations, which are more musically intuitive, can capture the same useful information as the nPVI. Specifically, counting the proportion of successive IOIs that are identical accounts for as much as 98\% of variation in nPVIs in musical corpora. I argue that abstract mathematical measures ought to be avoided in preference for more concrete empirical descriptions of specific rhythmic features, and that, rather than focusing on a single measure, multiple measures ought to be used. Finally, I conclude that the usage of nPVI in music research should be limited to specific methodologically justified contexts.

	abstract = {Research in music perception has typically focused on common-practice music (tonal music from the Western European tradition, ca. 1750–1900) as a model of Western musical structure. However, recent research indicates that different styles within Western tonal music may follow distinct harmonic syntaxes. The current study investigated whether listeners can adapt their harmonic expectations when listening to different musical styles. In two experiments, listeners were presented with short musical excerpts that primed either rock or classical music, followed by a timbre-matched cadence. Results from both experiments indicated that listeners prefer V-I cadences over bVII-I cadences within a classical context, but that this preference is significantly diminished in a rock context. Our findings provide empirical support for the idea that different musical styles do employ different harmonic syntaxes. Furthermore, listeners are not only sensitive to these differences, but are able to adapt their expectations dep...},

	url = {https://www.researchgate.net/publication/307981634},
	abstract = {Compositional authorship is often assigned though factors external to the musical text, such as biographical records and surveys of source attributions; however, such methodologies often fall short and are potentially unreliable. On the other hand, determining compositional authorship through internal factors-through stylistic traits of composers derived from the music itself-is often fraught with errors and biases. One of the underlying assumptions in the field of stylometry is that, while it is difficult for humans to perform a truly unbiased analysis of authorial attribution, computational methods can provide clearer and more objective guidelines than would otherwise be apparent to readers or listeners, and thus might provide corroboration or clues for further investigation. This paper discusses machine-learning approaches for evaluating attribution for compositions by Josquin des Prez. We explore musical characteristics such as melodic sequences, counterpoint motion, rhythmic variability, and other entry measures to search for features inherent to a composer's works or style, and we hope that employing such an approach-one that explicitly states which factors led to the decision-making process-can serve to inform scholars looking at other works and composers.},

Values of a set of 20 features (also called ''style markers'') are measured in the scores of a set of compositions, mainly describing the different sonorities in the compositions. For a first study over 300 different compositions of Bach, Han-del, Telemann, Mozart and Haydn were used and from this data set it was shown that even with a few features, the styles of the various composers could be separated with leave-one-out-error rates varying from 4\% to 9\% with the exception of the confusion between Mozart and Haydn which yielded a leave-one-out-error rate of 24\%. A second experiment included 30 fugues from J.S. Bach, W.F. Bach and J.L. Krebs, all of different style and character. With this data set of compositions of undisputed authorship, the F minor fugue for organ, BWV 534 (of which BachÕs authorship is disputed) then was confronted. It could be concluded that there is experimental evidence that J.L. Krebs should be considered in all probability as the composer of the fugue in question.},

This paper describes a new method for discovering patterns in the vertical and horizontal dimensions of polyphonic music. A formal representation of music objects is used to structure the musical surface, and several ideas for viewing pieces as successions of vertical structures are examined. A knowledge representation method is used to view pieces as sequences ofrelationships between music objects, and a pattern discovery algorithm is applied using this view of the Bach chorale harmonizations to find significant recurrent patterns. The method finds a small set of vertical patterns that occur in a large number of pieces in the corpus. Most of these patterns represent specific voice leading formulae within cadences.},

	abstract = {Jazz harmony relies heavily on a set of well-defined harmonic patterns that evolved gradually throughout the 20th century. While certain tonally-oriented progressions such as the "ii-V-I" appear to be nearly ubiquitous across time-periods, the jazz tradition also includes a notable departure from tonal harmony: the rise of modal jazz in the late 1950s. We aimed to systematically investigate the history of jazz composition by describing the evolution of chordal syntax, as well as the sort of organizational frameworks that might be described as harmonic schemata. In this study, we empirically describe the most common chords and chord motions of the jazz canon, and trace their evolution over time. Additionally, we describe an attempt to account for one particularly well-known compositional schema: the so-called "rhythm changes." In so doing, we make use of a recently compiled database of harmonic progressions for more than 1,160 jazz standards, encoded into the Humdrum "kern" format (Huron 1995). The present study provides details of corpus validation, and presents an initial descriptive characterization of the data set. Furthermore, we present evidence consistent with the hypothesis that chord sequences using tonal harmonic syntax became progressively less common from 1925 to 1970. Finally, we characterize the decline in popularity of one harmonic schema: the so-called "rhythm changes."},

	abstract = {One curious aspect of human timing is the organization of rhythmic patterns in small integer ratios. Behavioral and neural research has shown that adjacent time intervals in rhythms tend to be perceived and reproduced as approximate fractions of small numbers (e.g. 3/2). Recent work on iterated learning and reproduction further supports this: given a randomly timed drum pattern to reproduce, participants subconsciously transform it toward small integer ratios. The mechanisms accounting for this ‘attractor’ phenomenon are little understood, but might be explained by combining two theoretical frameworks from psychophysics. The scalar expectancy theory describes time interval perception and reproduction using Weber’s law: just detectable durational differences equal a constant fraction of the reference duration. The notion of categorical perception emphasises the tendency to perceive time intervals in categories, i.e. “short” vs. “long”. In this piece, we put forward the hypothesis that the integer-ratio bias in rhythm perception and production might arise from the interaction of the scalar property of timing with the categorical perception of time intervals, and that neurally it can plausibly be related to oscillatory activity. We support our integrative approach with mathematical derivations to formalise assumptions and provide testable predictions. We present equations to calculate predicted durational ratios by: (i) specifying one (of K) category of ratios, (ii) assuming a scalar timing constant, and (iii) parameterising the relationship between durational categories. Our derivations provide the basis for future computational, behavioural and neurophysiological work to test our model.},

	abstract = {In western tradition, mathematics and music have been connected for more than 2000 years. Despite this long history of relations between the two fields, the interest of "working mathematicians" in this research domain is a rather new phenomenon [9]. Whilst the power of applying mathematics to music has been acknowledged for a long time, it is only thanks to more recent developments that also music begins to occupy an important place in the development of mathematics. In fact, music has shown to provide a number of difficult theoretical problems, in particular for what concerns their constructive formalization and algorithmic solution. This asks for a permanent feedback between musical thought, mathematical formalisation and computational modelling, a dynamic movement between different disciplines that I suggested to call "mathemusical" [3]. This feedback between music and mathematics via computer science is illustrated in the diagram of Fig. 1. This paper provides an overview of the ongoing SMIR (Structural Music Information Research) Project, supported by the University of Strasbourg Institute for Advanced Study and carried on at the Institut de Recherche Mathématique Avancée (IRMA) in collaboration with the GREAM (Groupe de Recherche Expérimentale sur l'Acte Musical) and the Institut de Recherche et Coordination Acoustique/Musique (IRCAM).

	abstract = {While Wagner and his music have been studied extensively from musicological and music-theoretical perspectives, recent scientific approaches shed light on perceptual processes implicated in the experience of Wagner's music, yielding important insights into the (re)cognition of musical form. Since findings from such studies are mainly discussed within the realm of music psychology and rarely find their way (back) into musicological discourses, the starting point of the present study is a specific interpretation of form in the "Tristan" Prelude (Prelude to Tristan und Isolde) with a view to engaging in an exchange between music-theoretical and cognitive approaches (such as the theory of conceptual metaphor and image schema theory) to Wagner's music. In his article "Circular form in the 'Tristan' Prelude", Robert P. Morgan developed a new music-analytical approach to studying form in Wagner's music, proposing that the musical form of the Prelude can be understood as a circle. Morgan provides an empirically-tractable hypothesis which was tested in a listening study with 45 participants to investigate the extent to which Morgan's analytical shape is audibly perceived. Contrary to Morgan's circular interpretation of form in the "Tristan" Prelude, the findings of our study suggest the primacy of a different visual figure, the spiral. However, recourse to the analytic discourse suggests that the spiral can be understood as a further development of Morgan's figure of thought, synthesizing representations of the Prelude's repetition and development by capturing its unique coincidence of both linearity and circularity. This approach to understanding the "Tristan" Prelude demonstrates how applying music-theoretical and cognitive science approaches gives rise to a fruitful dialogue for both disciplines.},

	abstract = {Research on the music-language interface has extensively investigated similarities and differences of poetic and musical meter, but largely disregarded melody. Using a measure of melodic structure in music––autocorrelations of sound sequences consisting of discrete pitch and duration values––, we show that individual poems feature distinct and text-driven pitch and duration contours, just like songs and other pieces of music. We conceptualize these recurrent melodic contours as an additional, hitherto unnoticed dimension of parallelistic patterning. Poetic speech melodies are higher order units beyond the level of individual syntactic phrases, and also beyond the levels of individual sentences and verse lines. Importantly, auto-correlation scores for pitch and duration recurrences across stanzas are predictive of how melodious naive listeners perceive the respective poems to be, and how likely these poems were to be set to music by professional composers. Experimentally removing classical parallelistic features characteristic of prototypical poems (rhyme, meter, and others) led to decreased autocorrelation scores of pitches, independent of spoken renditions, along with reduced ratings for perceived melodiousness. This suggests that the higher order parallelistic feature of poetic melody strongly interacts with the other parallelistic patterns of poems. Our discovery of a genuine poetic speech melody has great potential for deepening the understanding of the music-language interface.},

	abstract = {In western tradition, mathematics and music have been connected for more than 2000 years. Despite this long history of relations between the two fields, the interest of "working mathematicians" in this research domain is a rather new phenomenon [9]. Whilst the power of applying mathematics to music has been acknowledged for a long time, it is only thanks to more recent developments that also music begins to occupy an important place in the development of mathematics. In fact, music has shown to provide a number of difficult theoretical problems, in particular for what concerns their constructive formalization and algorithmic solution. This asks for a permanent feedback between musical thought, mathematical formalisation and computational modelling, a dynamic movement between different disciplines that I suggested to call "mathemusical" [3]. This feedback between music and mathematics via computer science is illustrated in the diagram of Fig. 1. This paper provides an overview of the ongoing SMIR (Structural Music Information Research) Project, supported by the University of Strasbourg Institute for Advanced Study and carried on at the Institut de Recherche Mathématique Avancée (IRMA) in collaboration with the GREAM (Groupe de Recherche Expérimentale sur l'Acte Musical) and the Institut de Recherche et Coordination Acoustique/Musique (IRCAM).

When listening to music we constantly generate plausible hypotheses about what could happen next, while actively attending to music resolves the ensuing uncertainty. Within the predictive coding framework, we present a novel formulation of precision filtering and attentional selection, which explains why some lower-level auditory, and even higher-level music-syntactic processes elicited by irregular events are relatively exempt from top-down predictive processes. We review findings providing unique evidence for the attentional selection of salient auditory features. This formulation suggests that ‘listening’ is a more active process than traditionally conceived in models of perception.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the field of neuroaesthetics has gained considerable attention with music being a favored object of study. The majority of studies concerning music have, however, focused on the experience of Western tonal music, which is characterized by tonal hierarchical organization, a high degree of consonance, and a tendency to provide the listener with a tonic as a reference point during the listening experience. We argue that a narrow focus on Western tonal music may have led to a one-sided view regarding the qualities of the aesthetic experience of music since Western art music from the 20th and 21st century like atonal music – while lacking a tonal hierarchical structure, and while being highly dissonant and hard to predict – are nevertheless enjoyed by a group of avid listeners. We propose a research focus that investigates, in particular, the experience of atonal music as a novel and compelling way with which to enhance our understanding of both the aesthetic appreciation of music and the role of predictive models in the context of musical pleasure. We use music theoretical analysis and music information retrieval methods to demonstrate how atonal music presents the listener with a highly uncertain auditory environment. Specifically, an analysis of a corpus of 100 musical segments is used to illustrate how tonal classical music and atonal music differ quantitatively in terms of both key and pulse clarity values. We then examine person related, extrinsic and intrinsic factors, that point to potential mechanisms underlying the appreciation and pleasure derived from atonal music. We argue that personality traits like “openness to experience”, the framing of atonal music as art, and the mere exposure effect are key components of such mechanisms. We further argue that neural correlates of uncertainty estimation could represent a central mechanism for engaging with atonal music and that such contexts engender a comparatively weak predictive model in the listener. Finally we argue that in such uncertain contexts, correct predictions may be more subjectively rewarding than prediction errors since they signal to the individual that their predictive model is improving.},

Epidemiologists frequently collect data on multiple categorical variables with the goal of examining associations among these variables. Nevertheless, CA appears to be an underused technique in epidemiology. The objective of this article is to present the utility of CA in an epidemiological context. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING The theory and interpretation of CA in the case of two and more than two variables are illustrated through two examples. RESULTS The outcome from CA is a graphical display of the rows and columns of a contingency table that is designed to permit visualization of the salient relationships among the variable responses in a low-dimensional space. Such a representation reveals a more global picture of the relationships among row-column pairs, which would otherwise not be detected through a pairwise analysis. CONCLUSION When the study variables of interest are categorical, CA is an appropriate technique to explore the relationships among variable response categories and can play a complementary role in analyzing epidemiological data.},

In this article, I examine this phenomenon more systematically than has been done in the past. A good indicator of melodic-harmonic divorce is cases where non-chord-tones in the melody do not resolve by step. I argue that this does occur frequently in rock – often with respect to the local harmony, and sometimes with respect to the underlying tonic harmony as well. This melodic-harmonic ‘divorce’ tends to occur in rather specific circumstances: usually in pentatonically based melodies, and in verses rather than choruses. Such situations could be said to reflect a ‘stratified’ pitch organisation. A particularly common situation is where the verse of a song features stratified organisation, followed by a chorus which shifts to a ‘unified’ organisation in which both melody and accompaniment are regulated by the harmonic structure.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/div{\textgreater}},

Inference in this grammar is performed by collapsed variational inference, in which an amortized variational posterior is placed on the continuous variable, and the latent trees are marginalized with dynamic programming.

	abstract = {"First paperback printing, 2000." In addition to thus identifying Beethoven's music as an overarching expression of values central to the age of both Goethe and Hegel, the author describes and then critiques the process by which the musical values of the heroic style quickly became the controlling model of compositional logic in Western music criticism and analysis. Apart from its importance for students of Beethoven and his music, this book should appeal to all those interested in canon formation in the arts and in music as a cultural, ethical, and emotional force - in short, to anyone interested in the questions of what we want from music and what music does for us. Bringing together reception history, music analysis and criticism, the history of music theory, and the philosophy of music, Beethoven Hero explores the nature and persistence of Beethoven's heroic style. What have we come to value in this music, asks Scott Burnham, and why do generations of critics and analysts hear it in much the same way? Specifically, what is it that fosters the intensity of listener engagement with the heroic style, the often overwhelming sense of identification with its musical process? Starting with the story of heroic quest heard time and again in the first movement of the Eroica Symphony, Burnham suggests that Beethoven's music matters profoundly to its listeners because it projects an empowering sense of self, destiny, and freedom, while modeling ironic self-consciousness. 1. Beethoven's hero -- 2. Musical values: presence and engagement in the heroic style -- 3. Institutional values: Beethoven and the theorists -- 4. Cultural values: Beethoven, the Goethezeit, and the heroic concept of self -- 5. Beethoven hero.},

	title = {{SMOTE}: {Synthetic} {Minority} {Over}-sampling {Technique}},
	abstract = {An approach to the construction of classifiers from imbalanced datasets is described. A dataset is imbalanced if the classification categories are not approximately equally represented. Often real-world data sets are predominately composed of "normal" examples with only a small percentage of "abnormal" or "interesting" examples. It is also the case that the cost of misclassifying an abnormal (interesting) example as a normal example is often much higher than the cost of the reverse error. Under-sampling of the majority (nor-mal) class has been proposed as a good means of increasing the sensitivity of a classifier to the minority class. This paper shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority (abnormal) class and under-sampling the majority (normal) class can achieve better classifier performance (in ROC space) than only under-sampling the majority class. This paper also shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority class and under-sampling the majority class can achieve better classifier performance (in ROC space) than varying the loss ratios in Ripper or class priors in Naive Bayes. Our method of over-sampling the minority class involves creating synthetic minority class examples. Experiments are performed using C4.5, Ripper and a Naive Bayes classifier. The method is evaluated using the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC) and the ROC convex hull strategy.},

	abstract = {Experienced listeners internalize musical tonal knowledge via statistical learning of pitch distributions as a result of exposure to musical environment. Cross-cultural studies of music cognition offer new perspectives to investigate the acquisition of tonal schema. Makam music is a rich musical system characterized by modal structures defined by micro-tonal pitch sets, and melodic progression patterns (aka seyir features). Makam schema is possibly acquired by internalizing the seyir in addition to pitch features. In the current study, we examined whether an ideal model of makam schema is built with multidimensional scaling analysis and with self-organizing maps (SOMs). We were interested in whether statistical information about seyir features, in addition to pitch distributions, would form an acceptable makam schema model. We qualitatively analyzed topographical organizations in the models to understand whether they reflect complex relations between makams. Multidimensional scaling analyses did not produce an acceptable model for makam schema. The SOM trained with pitch distributions provided an adequate model for makam schema. However, the SOM trained with both pitch distributions and seyir features was better in capturing the complex relations between makams. Further behavioral research is necessary to understand whether melodic progression patterns are intrinsic features of the tonal knowledge of the experienced listeners of makam music.},

The study reveals that metrical strength and note lengths are highly correlated with affects, while correlations of pitch height, consonance, and mode are in general less significant, at times contradicting previous research. Measurements of minor vs. major chordal context and tonal certainty, however, reveal certain previously unknown differences among emotional states. The paper uses a larger dataset of observations and gives greater values of significance than has appeared in symbolic corpus analysis of emotions in the past, and includes general discussions and directions for future work.},

It is then applied to characterize five scale temperaments, as well as some minor and major triads and electronic amplification. In spite of the simplicity of the described model, a surprising agreement is often observed between the obtained consonances/dissonances and the typically observed properties of scales and chords. The representation of temperaments as graphs where links correspond to consonance (or dissonance) is presented and used to compare distinct temperaments, allowing the identification of two main groups of scales. The interesting issue of nonlinearities in electronic music amplification is also addressed while considering quadratic distortions, and it is shown that such nonlinearities can have drastic effect in changing the original patterns of consonance and dissonance.

The description and study of these rules, and the ordered structures that arise from them, is the basis of the field of music theory. Here, I present a theoretical formalism that aims to explain why basic ordered patterns emerge in music, using the same statistical mechanics framework that describes emergent order across phase transitions in physical systems. I first apply the mean field approximation to demonstrate that phase transitions occur in this model from disordered sound to discrete sets of pitches, including the 12-fold octave division used in Western music. Beyond the mean field model, I use numerical simulation to uncover emergent structures of musical harmony. These results provide a new lens through which to view the fundamental structures of music and to discover new musical ideas to explore.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The DFT, applied over the pitch-class domain rather than a temporal domain, is able to isolate significant and salient qualities characteristic of tonal pitch-class distributions, such as diatonicity and triadicity. The data reveal distinct historical trends in tonal distributions, the most significant of these is a marked decrease in diatonicity in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Comparing distributions for beginnings, endings , and whole pieces reveals a strong similarity between beginnings and whole pieces. Endings, by contrast, are more distinct in the properties of their distributions overall and show some historical trends not shared by beginnings and whole pieces, whose differences do not appear to interact with composer date.

The present study investigated tonal priming for mediants (the third scale degree) over leading tones (the seventh scale degree) presented in melodic contexts. Experiment 1 used a timbre discrimination task and Experiment 2 an intonation task. Facilitated processing was observed for the more tonally stable mediants over the less stable leading tones, thus showing that priming effects are not limited to pairs of tonal degrees including the tonic.

While this might to some extent converge with the unpleasant-pleasant continuum, subjective liking might diverge for various chord forms from music across different styles. Our study aimed to investigate how well appraisals of the roughness and pleasantness dimensions of isolated chords taken from real-world music are predicted by Parncutt’s established model of sensory dissonance. Furthermore, we related these subjective ratings to style of origin and acoustical features of the chords as well as musical sophistication of the raters. Ratings were obtained for chords deemed representative of the harmonic language of three different musical styles (classical, jazz and avant-garde music), plus randomly generated chords. Results indicate that pleasantness and roughness ratings were, on average, mirror opposites; however, their relative distribution differed greatly across styles, reflecting different underlying aesthetic ideals. Parncutt’s model only weakly predicted ratings for all but Classical chords, suggesting that listeners’ appraisal of the dissonance and pleasantness of chords bears not only on stimulus-side but also on listener-side factors. Indeed, we found that levels of musical sophistication negatively predicted listeners’ tendency to rate the consonance and pleasantness of any one chord as coupled measures, suggesting that musical education and expertise may serve to individuate how these musical dimensions are apprehended.},

	title = {Tonal music theory: {A} psychoacoustic explanation?},
	abstract = {From the seventeenth century to the present day, tonal harmonic music has had a number of invariant properties such as the use of specific chord progressions (cadences) to induce a sense of closure, the asymmetrical privileging of certain progressions, and the privileging of the major and minor scales. The most widely accepted explanation has been that this is due to a process of enculturation: frequently occurring musical patterns are learned by listeners, some of whom become composers and replicate the same patterns, which go on to influence the next “generation” of composers, and so on. In this paper, however, I present a possible psychoacoustic explanation for some important regularities of tonal-harmonic music. The core of the model is two different measures of pitch-based distance between chords. The first is voice-leading distance; the second is spectral pitch distance—a measure of the distance between the partials in one chord compared to those in another chord. I propose that when a pair of triads has a higher spectral distance than another pair of triads that is voice-leading-close, the former pair is heard as an alter},

However, the majority of these models rely on pitch information taken from melody alone. Given the prevalence of homophonic music in Western culture, however, surprisingly little attention has been directed at exploring the predictive power of harmonic accompaniment in models of melodic organization. The research presented here uses a combination of the three main approaches to empirical musicology-exploratory analysis, model-ing, and hypothesis testing-to investigate the influence of harmony on melodic behavior. In this study a comparison is made between models that use only melodic information and models that consider the melodic information along with the underlying harmonic accompaniment to predict melodic continuations. A test of overall performance shows a significant improvement using a melodic-harmonic model. When individual scale degrees are examined, the major diatonic scale degrees are shown to have unique probability distributions for each of their most common harmonic settings. That is, the results suggest a robust effect of harmony on melodic organization. Perceptual implications and directions for future research are discussed.},

The pieces are encoded in standard **kern format, with analyses jointly encoded using an extension to **kern. The harmonic content of the music was analyzed with both Roman numerals and function labels in duplicate by two different expert analyzers. The pieces are divided into musical phrases, allowing for multiple-levels of automatic analysis, including chord labeling and phrase parsing. This paper describes the content of the dataset in detail, including the types of chords represented, and discusses the ways in which the analyzers sometimes disagreed on the lower-level harmonic content (the Roman numerals) while converging at similar high-level structures (the function of the chords within the phrase).},

	abstract = {One important approach for knowledge discovery and data mining is to estimate unobserved variables because latent variables can indicate hidden specific properties of observed data. The latent factor model assumes that each item in a record has a latent factor; the cooccurrence of items can then be modeled by latent factors. In document modeling, a record indicates a document represented as a “bag of words,” meaning that the order of words is ignored, an item indicates a word and a latent factor indicates a topic. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a widely used Bayesian topic model applying the Dirichlet distribution over the latent topic distribution of a document having multiple topics. LDA assumes that latent topics, i.e., discrete latent variables, are distributed according to a multinomial distribution whose parameters are generated from the Dirichlet distribution. LDA also models a word distribution by using a multinomial distribution whose parameters follows the Dirichlet distribution. This Dirichlet-multinomial setting, however, cannot capture the power-law phenomenon of a word distribution, which is known as Zipf’s law in linguistics. We therefore propose a novel topic model using the Pitman-Yor(PY) process, called the PY topic model. The PY topic model captures two properties of a document; a power-law word distribution and the presence of multiple topics. In an experiment using real data, this model outperformed LDA in document modeling in terms of perplexity},

We use a binomial finite mixture to model the number of credits gained by freshmen during the first year at the School of Economics of the University of Florence. The finite mixture approach allows us to appropriately account for the large number of zeroes and the multimodality of the observed distribution. Moreover, we rely on a concomitant variable specification to investigate the role of student background characteristics and of a compulsory pre-enrollment test in predicting gained credits. In the paper, we deal with model selection, including the choice of the number of components, and we devise numerical and graphical summaries of the model results in order to exploit the information content of the concomitant variable specification. The main finding is that the introduction of the pre-enrollment test gives additional information for student tutoring, even if the predictive power is modest. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

	abstract = {Within the last fifteen years, the field of Music Information Retrieval (MIR) has made tremendous progress in the development of algorithms for organizing and analyzing the ever-increasing large and varied amount of music and music-related data available digitally. However, the development of content-based methods to enable or improve multimedia retrieval still remains a central challenge. In this perspective paper, we critically look at the problem of automatic chord estimation from audio recordings as a case study of content-based algorithms, and point out several bottlenecks in current approaches: expressiveness and flexibility are obtained to the expense of robustness and vice-versa; available multimodal sources of information are little exploited; modeling multi-faceted and strongly interrelated musical information is limited with current architectures; models are typically restricted to short-term analysis that does not account for the hierarchical temporal structure of musical signals. Dealing with music data requires the ability to handle both uncertainty and complex relational structure at multiple levels of representation. Traditional approaches have generally treated these two aspects separately, probability and learning being the standard way to represent uncertainty in knowledge, while logical representation being the standard way to represent knowledge and complex relational information. We advocate that the identified hurdles of current approaches could be overcome by recent developments in the area of Statistical Relational Artificial Intelligence (StarAI) that unifies probability, logic and (deep) learning. We show that existing approaches used in MIR find powerful extensions and unifications in StarAI, and we explain why we think it is time to consider the new perspectives offered by this promising research field.},

We investigate how factors such as training data size, training corpus (e.g. Brown vs. Wall Street Journal), count cutoffs, and n -gram order (bigram vs. trigram) affect the relative performance of these methods, which is measured through the cross-entropy of test data. We find that these factors can significantly affect the relative performance of models, with the most significant factor being training data size. Since no previous comparisons have examined these factors systematically, this is the first thorough characterization of the relative performance of various algorithms. In addition, we introduce methodologies for analyzing smoothing algorithm efficacy in detail, and using these techniques we motivate a novel variation of Kneser–Ney smoothing that consistently outperforms all other algorithms evaluated. Finally, results showing that improved language model smoothing leads to improved speech recognition performance are presented.},

	title = {Beyond subjective and objective in statistics},
	abstract = {Decisions in statistical data analysis are often justified, criticized, or avoided by using concepts of objectivity and subjectivity. We argue that the words 'objective' and 'sub-jective' in statistics discourse are used in a mostly unhelpful way, and we propose to replace each of them with broader collections of attributes, with objectivity replaced by transparency , consensus, impartiality and correspondence to observable reality , and subjectivity replaced by awareness of multiple perspectives and context dependence. Together with stability , these make up a collection of virtues that we think is helpful in discussions of statistical foundations and practice. The advantage of these reformulations is that the replacement terms do not oppose each other and that they give more specific guidance about what statistical science strives to achieve. Instead of debating over whether a given statistical method is subjective or objective (or normatively debating the relative merits of subjectivity and objectivity in statistical practice), we can recognize desirable attributes such as transparency and acknowledgement of multiple perspectives as complementary goals. We demonstrate the implications of our proposal with recent applied examples from pharmacology, election polling and socioeconomic stratification. The aim of the paper is to push users and developers of statistical methods towards more effective use of diverse sources of information and more open acknowledgement of assumptions and goals.},

We formalize and discuss the significance of 44 cadential features, correlated with the occurrence of cadences in scores. These features describe properties at the arrival beat of a cadence and its surroundings, but also at other onsets heuristically identified to pinpoint chords preparing the cadence. The representation of each beat of the score as a vector of ca-dential features makes it possible to reformulate cadence detection as a classification task. An SVM classifier was run on two corpora from Bach and Haydn totaling 162 perfect authentic cadences and 70 half cadences. In these corpora , the classifier correctly identified more than 75\% of perfect authentic cadences and 50\% of half cadences, with low false positive rates. The experiment results are consistent with common knowledge that classification is more complex for half cadences than for authentic cadences.},

	abstract = {Tonal music, from a historical perspective, is far from homogenous; yet an enduring feature is a background "diatonic" system of exactly seven notes orderable cyclically by fifth. What is the source of the durability of the diatonic system, the octave of which is representable in terms of two particular integers, namely 12 and 7? And how is this durability consistent with the equally remarkable variety of musical styles — or languages — that the history of Western tonal music has taught us exist? This book is an attempt to answer these questions. Using mathematical tools to describe and explain the Western musical system as a highly sophisticated communication system, this theoretical, historical, and cognitive study is unprecedented in scope and depth. The author engages in intense dialogue with 1000 years of music-theoretical thinking, offering answers to some of the most enduring questions concerning Western tonality. The book is divided into two main parts, both governed by the communicative premise. Part I studies proto-tonality, the background system of notes prior to the selection of a privileged note known as "final." After some preliminaries that concern consonance and chromaticism, Part II begins with the notion "mode." A mode is "dyadic" or "triadic," depending on its "nucleus." Further, a "key" is a special type of "semi-key" which is a special type of mode. Different combinations of these categories account for tonal variety. Ninth-century music, for example, is a tonal language of dyadic modes, while seventeenth-century music is a language of triadic semi-keys. While portions of the book are characterized by abstraction and formal rigor, more suitable for expert readers, it will also be of value to anyone intrigued by the tonal phenomenon at large, including music theorists, musicologists, and music-cognition researchers. The content is supported by a general index, a list of definitions, a list of notation used, and two appendices providing the basic mathematical background.},

Our model relies on a careful analysis of the google-ngram database of books published in the last centuries and its main consequence is the generalization of Zipf's and Heaps' law to two scaling regimes. We confirm that these generalizations yield the best simple description of the data among generic descriptive models and that the two free parameters depend only on the language but not on the database. From the point of view of our model the main change on historical time scales is the composition of the specific words included in the finite list of core-words, which we observe to decay exponentially in time with a rate of approximately 30 words per year for English.},

Both the domains use basic units (e.g., words and notes) to build rule-governed higher order representations (e.g., phrases and melodies). neither language processing nor musical processing proceeds by retrieving ‘already-constructed’ well- formed sentences or melodies from long-term memory. sentences are constructed in real-time processing by putting together constituents. humans can, therefore, understand the meaning of a completely novel sentence, which suggests that language processing proceeds by accessing certain rules, which puts together certain elements from an existing small inventory of primitives. in a similar fashion, music involves production and processing of novel elements combining in a principled manner. studies have shown that such sequences are perceived in a meaningful way (antovi«c 2009, Koelsch 2011). how are these two processes inter-related?},

The specific task under investigation is pitch spelling , that is, how traditional score notation can be derived from a simple unstructured 12-tone representation (e.g., pitch-class set or MIDI pitch representation). This study provides useful insights both into the domain of pitch perception and into musicological aspects of score notation strategies. A computational model is described that transcribes polyphonic MIDI pitch files into the Western traditional music notation. Input to the proposed algorithm is merely a sequence of MIDI pitch numbers in the order they appear in a MIDI file. No a priori knowledge such as key signature, tonal centers, time signature, chords, or voice separation is required. Output of the algorithm is a sequence of "correctly" spelled pitches. The algorithm is based on an interval optimization approach that takes into account the frequency of occurrence of pitch intervals within the major-minor tonal scale framework. The algorithm was evaluated on 10 complete piano sonatas by Mozart and had a success rate of 98.8\% (634 pitches were spelled incorrectly out of a total of 54,418 notes); it was tested additionally on three Chopin waltzes and had a slightly worse success rate. The proposed pitch interval optimization approach is also compared with and tested against other pitch-spelling strategies.},

	abstract = {We present an comparison between two recent approaches to the harmonic similarity of musical chords sequences. In contrast to earlier work, that mainly focuses on the similarity of musical scores or musical audio, in this paper we specifically use on the symbolic chord description as the primary musical representation and the similarity between sequences of these descriptions. In an experiment we compare a geometrical and an alignment approach to harmonic similarity, and measure the effects of chord description detail and a priori key information on retrieval performance. For this experiment a large new chord sequence corpus is assembled. The results show that a computational costly alignment approach significantly outperforms a much faster geometrical approach in most cases, that a priori key information boosts retrieval performance, and that using a triadic chord representation yields significantly better results than using more simple or more complex chord representations.},

	abstract = {To assess the quality of the fit in a multiple linear regression, the coefficient of determination or R2 is a very simple tool, yet the most used by practitioners. Indeed, it is reported in most statistical analyzes, and although it is not recommended as a final model selection tool, it provides an indication of the suitability of the chosen explanatory variables in predicting the response. In the classical setting, it is well known that the least-squares fit and coefficient of determination can be arbitrary and/or misleading in the presence of a single outlier. In many applied settings, the assumption of normality of the errors and the absence of outliers are difficult to establish. In these cases, robust procedures for estimation and inference in linear regression are available and provide a suitable alternative. In this paper we present a companion robust coefficient of determination that has several desirable properties not shared by others. It is robust to deviations from the specified regression model (like the presence of outliers), it is efficient if the errors are normally distributed, it does not make any assumption on the distribution of the explanatory variables (and therefore no assumption on the unconditional distribution of the responses). We also show that it is a consistent estimator of the population coefficient of determination. A simulation study and two real datasets support the appropriateness of this estimator, compared with classical (least-squares) and several previously proposed robust R2, even for small sample sizes.},

	abstract = {An integral part of human language is the capacity to extract meaning from spoken and written words, but the precise relationship between brain representations of information perceived by listening versus reading is unclear. Prior neuroimaging studies have shown that semantic information in spoken language is represented in multiple regions in the human cerebral cortex, while amodal semantic information appears to be represented in a few broad brain regions. However, previous studies were too insensitive to determine whether semantic representations were shared at a fine level of detail rather than merely at a coarse scale. We used fMRI to record brain activity in two separate experiments while participants listened to or read several hours of the same narrative stories, and then created voxelwise encoding models to characterize semantic selectivity in each voxel and in each individual participant. We find that semantic tuning during listening and reading are highly correlated in most semantically-selective regions of cortex, and models estimated using one modality accurately predict voxel responses in the other modality. These results suggest that the representation of language semantics is independent of the sensory modality through which the semantic information is received.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT

Humans can comprehend the meaning of words from both spoken and written language. It is therefore important to understand the relationship between the brain representations of spoken or written text. Here we show that although the representation of semantic information in the human brain is quite complex, the semantic representations evoked by listening versus reading are almost identical. These results suggest that the representation of language semantics is independent of the sensory modality through which the semantic information is received.},

It has been suggested that this aversion to ambiguity is linked to people’s assumption of worst possible outcomes. We used two closely linked behavioural tasks in 78 healthy participants to investigate whether such pessimistic prior beliefs can explain ambiguity aversion. In the risk-taking task, participants had to decide whether or not they place a bet, while in the beliefs task, participants were asked what they believed would be the outcome. Unexpectedly, we found that in the beliefs task, participants were not overly pessimistic about the outcome in the ambiguity condition and in fact closer to optimal levels of decision-making than in the risk conditions. While individual differences in pessimism could explain outcome expectancy, they had no effect on ambiguity aversion. Consequently, ambiguity aversion is more likely caused by general caution than by expectation of negative outcomes despite pessimism-dependent subjective weighting of probabilities.},

The development of harmonic tonality creates difficulties for a scientific rationale in so far as tonality, on the one hand, can be regarded as an object of systemic nature, but on the other hand, has emerged historically from the gradual convergence of its constitutive elements. Understanding a system and understanding a historical development call for different strategies of perception and methods of securing scientificity.

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited. Learning and knowledge of transitional probability in sequences like music, called statistical learning and knowledge, are considered implicit processes that occur without intention to learn and awareness of what one knows. This implicit statistical knowledge can be alternatively expressed via abstract medium such as musical melody, which suggests this knowledge is reflected in melodies written by a composer. This study investigates how statistics in music vary over a composer’s lifetime. Transitional probabilities of highest-pitch sequences in Ludwig van Beethoven’s Piano Sonata were calculated based on different hierarchical Markov models. Each interval pattern was ordered based on the sonata opus number. The transitional probabilities of sequential patterns that are musical universal in music gradually decreased, suggesting that time-course variations of statistics in music reflect time-course variations of a composer’s statistical knowledge. This study sheds new light on novel methodologies that may be able to evaluate the time-course variation of composer’s implicit knowledge using musical scores.},

We present a polyphonic transcription method that converts a music audio signal into a human-readable musical score, by integrating multi-pitch de-tection and rhythm quantization methods. This integration is made difficult by the fact that the multi-pitch detection produces erroneous notes such as extra notes and introduces timing errors that are added to temporal deviations due to musical expression. Thus, we propose a rhythm quantization method that can remove extra notes by extend-ing the metrical hidden Markov model and optimize the model pa-rameters. We also improve the note-tracking process of multi-pitch detection by refining the treatment of repeated notes and adjustment of onset times. Finally, we propose evaluation measures for tran-scribed scores. Systematic evaluations on commonly used classical piano data show that these treatments improve the performance of transcription, which can be used as benchmarks for further studies.},

In order to judge similarity of melodies on the level of melodic segments, a successful similarity measure is needed which will allow finding occurrences of melodic segments in folk songs reliably. The present study compares several such similarity measures from different music research domains: correlation distance, city block distance, Euclidean distance, local align-ment, wavelet transform and structure induction. We evaluate the measures against annotations of phrase occurrences in a corpus of Dutch folk songs, observing whether the mea-sures detect annotated occurrences at the correct positions. Moreover, we investigate the influence of music represen-tation on the success of the various measures, and analyse the robustness of the most successful measures over subsets of the data. Our results reveal that structure induction is a promising approach, but that local alignment and city block distance perform even better when applied to adjusted music representations. These three methods can be combined to find occurrences with increased precision.},

Thus, a note is classified as a harmonic tone when it belongs to the underlying chord, and as a non-harmonic tone otherwise, with a number of categories in this latter case. Automatic systems for fully solving this task without errors are still far from being available, so it must be assumed that, in a practical scenario in which the melodic analysis is the system’s final output, the human expert mus make corrections to the output in order to achieve the final result. Interactive systems allow for turning the user into a source of high-quality and high-confidence ground-truth data, so online machine learning and interactive pattern recognition provide tools that have proven to be very convenient in this context. Experimental evidence will be presented showing that this seems to be a suitable way to approach melodic analysis.},

This has led to a growing role and visibility of the contribution of (bio)musicology to the field of neuroscience and cognitive sciences at large. While it has been widely acknowledged that there are commonalities between speech, language, and musicality, several researchers explain this by considering musicality as an epiphenomenon of language. However, an alternative hypothesis is that musicality is an innate and widely shared capacity for music that can be seen as a natural, spontaneously developing set of traits based on and constrained by our cognitive abilities and their underlying biology. A comparative study of musicality in humans and well‐known animal models (monkeys, birds, pinnipeds) will further our insights on which features of musicality are exclusive to humans and which are shared between humans and nonhuman animals, contribute to an understanding of the musical phenotype, and further constrain existing evolutionary theories of music and musicality.

	abstract = {Current automatic chord estimation systems are trained and tested using datasets that contain single reference annotations, i.e., for each corresponding musical segment (e.g., audio frame or section), the reference annotation contains a single chord label. Nevertheless, theoretical insights on harmonic ambiguity from harmony theory, experimental studies on annotator subjectivity in harmony annotations, and the availability of vast amounts of heterogeneous (subjective) harmony anno- tations in crowd-sourced repositories make the notion of a single-harmonic ‘‘ground truth’’ reference annotation a tenuous one. Recent studies suggest that subjectivity is intrinsic to harmonic reference annotations that should be embraced in automatic chord estimation rather than resolved. We introduce the first approach to automatic chord label personalization by modeling annotator subjectivity through harmonic interval-based chord representations. We integrate these represen- tations from multiple annotators and deep learn them from audio. From a single trained model and the annotators’ chord- label vocabulary, we can accurately personalize chord labels for individual annotators. Furthermore, we show that chord personalization using multiple reference annotations outperforms using just a single reference annotation. Our results show that annotator subjectivity should inform future research on automatic chord estimation to improve the state of the art.},

The paper begins by showing that LDA topic models can be viewed as a special kind of PCFG, so Bayesian in-ference for PCFGs can be used to infer Topic Models as well. Adaptor Grammars (AGs) are a hierarchical, non-parameteric Bayesian extension of PCFGs. Exploit-ing the close relationship between LDA and PCFGs just described, we propose two novel probabilistic models that com-bine insights from LDA and AG models.

In this article, we test three typical Humanities research problems: in the first, a researcher wants to find text passages that exhibit similarities to a collection of influential non literary texts from a single author (here, Darwin); in the second, a researcher wants to discover literary passages related to a well understood corpus of literary texts (here, emblematic texts from the Modern Breakthrough); and in the third, a researcher hopes to understand the influence that a particular domain (here, folklore) has had on the realm of literature over a series of decades.

In contrast to other approaches that remain purely theoretical, we present an implemented system that is evaluated empirically. Given a sequence of symbolic chord labels, HarmTrace automatically derives the harmonic relations between chords. For this, we use advanced functional programming techniques that are uniquely available in the Haskell programming language.

	doi = {10.1080/09298210008565465},
	abstract = {During the past centuries a great many ways have been proposed to divide the octave into smaller units. The twelve semitones have been by far the most often proposed and used, but many systems with sometimes much more steps in the octave have been developed as well. There are basically two ways to construct these systems with multiple steps: either subdividing the octave into an arbitrary number of equal steps (the ensuing systems are often called multiple divisions), or building intervals by addition from basic intervals. The basic intervals then follow the order of prime numbers in their frequency ratios: 2:3 (perfect fifth), 4:5 (just major third),4:7 ('harmonic seventh'), etc. This method ties behind the just intonations. In this paper it will be shown that in both cases the various systems can be most efficiently described in terms of the circle of fifths. Methods are given to derive from the basic premises of the systems one or more circles of fifths, which encompass all the notes of the systems and relate all the notes to one another. Of course, the main property of a circle of fifths is the number of fifths comprised in it. In both classes there are certain systems which seem to be preferred both by theorists and by composers because in them the consonant intervals (perfect fifth, major third,...) deviate least from their just form (2:3,4:5,...). It is shown that these preferred systems have certain numbers of tones in their circles of fifths, such as 12, 19, 24, 31, 34, 41, 46, and 48, and that these preferred numbers of tones in the circles of fifth occur both regarding the multiple divisions and regarding the just intonations. It appears as well that the number of circles of fifth in a system with a given number of notes is usually the same, regardless whether the system is a multiple division or a just intonation. In this way the two classes, which seem quite apart from the point of view of their construction, are tied together by one single concept: the circle of fifths.},

	url = {http://web.auth.gr/cim08/},
	abstract = {Background in music theory. Although strictly prohibited since the 14th century, parallel fifths can be detected in medieval and Renaissance music, mainly in cadential passages of works written even by composers such as Palestrina and Lassus. In addition, as Brahms has pointed out (1980), almost all 'great masters' (17th-19th centuries) did not always seem to care to avoid successions in parallel fifths. In his commentary upon Brahms's facsimile, Schenker argued that within the prolongation of one triad the rules of strict counterpoint may not apply; consequently that, "… consecutive octaves or fifths need not be considered wrong". So, there are cases in which, even if parallel fifths appear in the score, they do not convey the effect of hollowness, emptiness or stillness that parallel fifths may have on listeners. With respect to Bach's four-part harmonizations of chorale melodies, Malcolm Boyd identified a couple of cases in which parallel fifths do appear, suggesting that one could suspect, "… that either the text is at these points corrupt, or that Bach has not spotted the consecutives and would have corrected them if he had". Background in computer science. There are few available tools for expressing and searching for complex relational networks of notes such as the parallel fifth. The Humdrum toolkit (Huron, 1997) provides methods for transforming scores to harmonic interval successions, but it is difficult to formulate accurate (with high precision and recall) pattern queries for complex networks involving several properties of notes and simultaneities as arise in the parallel fifth. The PROLOG logic programming language is very well suited to elegantly express and efficiently execute such queries.},

Inference in the simpified model provides bounds on probabilities of interest in the original model.

It discovers a set of “topics” — recurring themes that are discussed in the collection — and the degree to which each document exhibits those topics. Figure 1 illustrates topics found by running a topic model on 1.8 million articles from the New York Times. The model gives us a framework in which to explore and analyze the texts, but we did not need to decide on the topics in advance or painstakingly code each document according to them. The model algorithmically finds a way of representing documents that is useful for navigating and understanding the collection. In this essay I will discuss topic models and how they relate to digital humanities. I will describe latent Dirichlet allocation, the simplest topic model. I will explain what a “topic” is from the mathematical perspective and why algorithms can discover topics from collections of texts.[1] I will then discuss the broader field of probabilistic modeling, which gives a flexible language for expressing assumptions about data and a set of algorithms for computing under those assumptions. With probabilistic modeling for the humanities, the scholar can build a statistical lens that encodes her specific knowledge, theories, and assumptions about texts. She can then use that lens to examine and explore large archives of real sources.},

	abstract = {A substantial school in the philosophy of science identifies Bayesian inference with inductive inference and even rationality as such, and seems to be strengthened by the rise and practical success of Bayesian statistics. We argue that the most successful forms of Bayesian statistics do not actually support that particular philosophy but rather accord much better with sophisticated forms of hypothetico-deductivism. We examine the actual role played by prior distributions in Bayesian models, and the crucial aspects of model checking and model revision, which fall outside the scope of Bayesian confirmation theory. We draw on the literature on the consistency of Bayesian updating and also on our experience of applied work in social science. Clarity about these matters should benefit not just philosophy of science, but also statistical practice. At best, the inductivist view has encouraged researchers to fit and compare models without checking them; at worst, theorists have actively discouraged practitioners from performing model checking because it does not fit into their framework.},

	abstract = {The establishment of the Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) in the late 1980s allowed hobbyists and musicians to experiment with sound control in ways that previously had been possible only in research studios. MIDI is now the most prevalent representation of music, but what it represents is based on hardware control protocols for sound synthesis. Programs that support sound input for graphics output necessarily span a gamut of representational categories. What is most likely to be lost is any sense of the musical work. Thus, for those involved in pedagogy, analysis, simulation, notation, and music theory, the nature of the representation matters a great deal. An understanding of the data requirements of different applications is fundamental to the creation of interchange codes. The contributors to 'Beyond MIDI' present a broad range of schemes, illustrating a wide variety of approaches to music representation. Generally, each chapter describes the history and intended purposes of the code, a description of the representation of the primary attributes of music (pitch, duration, articulation, ornamentation, dynamics, and timbre), a description of the file organization, some mention of existing data in the format, resources for further information, and at least one encoded example. The book also shows how intended applications influence the kinds of musical information that are encoded. Describing musical information / Eleanor Selfridge-Field -- MIDI / Walter B.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The three experiments reported here investigate how pitch and time interact in perception using the standard rhythmic pattern and the diatonic scale pattern, which share the intervallic structure of 2 2 1 2 2 2 1. They share a number of theoretical properties, including being cyclic with seven unique rotations. Experiment 1 measured rhythmic stability by dynamically accenting each of the events in each rhythm, called the probe accent; listeners rated how well the probe accent fit the rhythm. Listeners heard the rhythms in subgroups and with reference to a syncopation-shifted metrical hierarchy. Experiment 2 used the probe tone technique to measure the tonal stability of each tone in each mode beginning and ending on C. Higher ratings were given to tones earlier in the contexts and tones closer to C on both the chroma circle and the circle of fifths; influences were also found of tonal hierarchies of diatonic scales with corresponding accidentals. A measure of similarity derived from the probe ratings found the same order for the rhythms and modes which matched theoretical proposals of inter-rhythm and inter-mode distances. Experiment 3 presented all combinations of rhythms and modes; listeners judged how well the rhythm fit the mode. These judgments did not depend on the intervallic isomorphism between tone duration and interval size. Instead, the judgments depended on whether tonally stable events occurred where accents were judged as fitting well with the rhythm. Overall, the standard and diatonic patterns follow different perceptual hierarchies while sharing similar cognitive principles between rhythms, between modes, and across dimensions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

His techniques of serial row chaining and associative organization create a deep musical hierarchy that is frequently navigated by a formal principle of large-scale complementation. The analyses appearing here are drawn from across Webern’s twelve-tone period and are elucidated through spatial representations that describe compositional potential and musical realization. In addition to providing a means for analytical interpretation, the analyses reveal how Webern’s fusion of form and twelve-tone technique resemble characteristics of the tonal system while amplifying basic axioms of serial composition.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

They conclude that music can function as a reward, that musical expectations are linked to pleasure, and that musical rewards motivate learning. We applaud the multifaceted methodological approach, which combines neuroimaging, behavioral data, and computational modeling. However, we believe that some of the conclusions put forward are not warranted by the evidence presented.

We probed pitch representations in residents of the Bolivian Amazon—the Tsimane', who live in relative isolation from Western culture—as well as US musicians and non-musicians. Participants sang back tone sequences presented in different frequency ranges. Sung responses of Amazonian and US participants approximately replicated heard intervals on a logarithmic scale, even for tones outside the singing range. Moreover, Amazonian and US reproductions both deteriorated for high-frequency tones even though they were fully audible. But whereas US participants tended to reproduce notes an integer number of octaves above or below the heard tones, Amazonians did not, ignoring the note “chroma” (C, D, etc.). Chroma matching in US participants was more pronounced in US musicians than non-musicians, was not affected by feedback, and was correlated with similarity-based measures of octave equivalence as well as the ability to match the absolute f0 of a stimulus in the singing range. The results suggest the cross-cultural presence of logarithmic scales for pitch, and biological constraints on the limits of pitch, but indicate that octave equivalence may be culturally contingent, plausibly dependent on pitch representations that develop from experience with particular musical systems.

	abstract = {Topic models such as the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) have become a standard staple in the modeling toolbox of machine learning. They have been applied to a vast variety of data sets, contexts, and tasks to varying degrees of success. However, to date there is almost no formal theory explicating the LDA's behavior, and despite its familiarity there is very little systematic analysis of and guidance on the properties of the data that affect the inferential performance of the model. This paper seeks to address this gap, by providing a systematic analysis of factors which characterize the LDA's performance. We present theorems elucidating the posterior contraction rates of the topics as the amount of data increases, and a thorough supporting empirical study using synthetic and real data sets, including news and web-based articles and tweet messages. Based on these results we provide practical guidance on how to identify suitable data sets for topic models, and how to specify particular model parameters.},

Practitioners typically assume that the latent space is semantically meaningful. It is used to check models, summarize the corpus, and guide exploration of its contents. However, whether the latent space is interpretable is in need of quantitative evaluation. In this paper, we present new quantitative methods for measuring semantic meaning in inferred topics. We back these measures with large-scale user studies, showing that they capture aspects of the model that are undetected by previous measures of model quality based on held-out likelihood. Surprisingly, topic models which perform better on held-out likelihood may infer less semantically meaningful topics.},

	abstract = {The three experiments reported here investigate how pitch and time interact in perception using the standard rhythmic pattern and the diatonic scale pattern, which share the intervallic structure of 2 2 1 2 2 2 1. They share a number of theoretical properties, including being cyclic with seven unique rotations. Experiment 1 measured rhythmic stability by dynamically accenting each of the events in each rhythm, called the probe accent; listeners rated how well the probe accent fit the rhythm. Listeners heard the rhythms in subgroups and with reference to a syncopation-shifted metrical hierarchy. Experiment 2 used the probe tone technique to measure the tonal stability of each tone in each mode beginning and ending on C. Higher ratings were given to tones earlier in the contexts and tones closer to C on both the chroma circle and the circle of fifths; influences were also found of tonal hierarchies of diatonic scales with corresponding accidentals. A measure of similarity derived from the probe ratings found the same order for the rhythms and modes which matched theoretical proposals of inter-rhythm and inter-mode distances. Experiment 3 presented all combinations of rhythms and modes; listeners judged how well the rhythm fit the mode. These judgments did not depend on the intervallic isomorphism between tone duration and interval size. Instead, the judgments depended on whether tonally stable events occurred where accents were judged as fitting well with the rhythm. Overall, the standard and diatonic patterns follow different perceptual hierarchies while sharing similar cognitive principles between rhythms, between modes, and across dimensions.},

His techniques of serial row chaining and associative organization create a deep musical hierarchy that is frequently navigated by a formal principle of large-scale complementation. The analyses appearing here are drawn from across Webern’s twelve-tone period and are elucidated through spatial representations that describe compositional potential and musical realization. In addition to providing a means for analytical interpretation, the analyses reveal how Webern’s fusion of form and twelve-tone technique resemble characteristics of the tonal system while amplifying basic axioms of serial composition.},

They conclude that music can function as a reward, that musical expectations are linked to pleasure, and that musical rewards motivate learning. We applaud the multifaceted methodological approach, which combines neuroimaging, behavioral data, and computational modeling. However, we believe that some of the conclusions put forward are not warranted by the evidence presented.

	abstract = {Topic models such as the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) have become a standard staple in the modeling toolbox of machine learning. They have been applied to a vast variety of data sets, contexts, and tasks to varying degrees of success. However, to date there is almost no formal theory explicating the LDA's behavior, and despite its familiarity there is very little systematic analysis of and guidance on the properties of the data that affect the inferential performance of the model. This paper seeks to address this gap, by providing a systematic analysis of factors which characterize the LDA's performance. We present theorems elucidating the posterior contraction rates of the topics as the amount of data increases, and a thorough supporting empirical study using synthetic and real data sets, including news and web-based articles and tweet messages. Based on these results we provide practical guidance on how to identify suitable data sets for topic models, and how to specify particular model parameters.},

Practitioners typically assume that the latent space is semantically meaningful. It is used to check models, summarize the corpus, and guide exploration of its contents. However, whether the latent space is interpretable is in need of quantitative evaluation. In this paper, we present new quantitative methods for measuring semantic meaning in inferred topics. We back these measures with large-scale user studies, showing that they capture aspects of the model that are undetected by previous measures of model quality based on held-out likelihood. Surprisingly, topic models which perform better on held-out likelihood may infer less semantically meaningful topics.},

	abstract = {In this article, cognitive and musicological aspects of pitch and pitch interval representations are explored via computational modeling. The specific task under investigation is pitch spelling , that is, how traditional score notation can be derived from a simple unstructured 12-tone representation (e.g., pitch-class set or MIDI pitch representation). This study provides useful insights both into the domain of pitch perception and into musicological aspects of score notation strategies. A computational model is described that transcribes polyphonic MIDI pitch files into the Western traditional music notation. Input to the proposed algorithm is merely a sequence of MIDI pitch numbers in the order they appear in a MIDI file. No a priori knowledge such as key signature, tonal centers, time signature, chords, or voice separation is required. Output of the algorithm is a sequence of "correctly" spelled pitches. The algorithm is based on an interval optimization approach that takes into account the frequency of occurrence of pitch intervals within the major-minor tonal scale framework. The algorithm was evaluated on 10 complete piano sonatas by Mozart and had a success rate of 98.8\% (634 pitches were spelled incorrectly out of a total of 54,418 notes); it was tested additionally on three Chopin waltzes and had a slightly worse success rate. The proposed pitch interval optimization approach is also compared with and tested against other pitch-spelling strategies.},

	abstract = {An integral part of human language is the capacity to extract meaning from spoken and written words, but the precise relationship between brain representations of information perceived by listening versus reading is unclear. Prior neuroimaging studies have shown that semantic information in spoken language is represented in multiple regions in the human cerebral cortex, while amodal semantic information appears to be represented in a few broad brain regions. However, previous studies were too insensitive to determine whether semantic representations were shared at a fine level of detail rather than merely at a coarse scale. We used fMRI to record brain activity in two separate experiments while participants listened to or read several hours of the same narrative stories, and then created voxelwise encoding models to characterize semantic selectivity in each voxel and in each individual participant. We find that semantic tuning during listening and reading are highly correlated in most semantically-selective regions of cortex, and models estimated using one modality accurately predict voxel responses in the other modality. These results suggest that the representation of language semantics is independent of the sensory modality through which the semantic information is received.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT

Humans can comprehend the meaning of words from both spoken and written language. It is therefore important to understand the relationship between the brain representations of spoken or written text. Here we show that although the representation of semantic information in the human brain is quite complex, the semantic representations evoked by listening versus reading are almost identical. These results suggest that the representation of language semantics is independent of the sensory modality through which the semantic information is received.},

It has been suggested that this aversion to ambiguity is linked to people’s assumption of worst possible outcomes. We used two closely linked behavioural tasks in 78 healthy participants to investigate whether such pessimistic prior beliefs can explain ambiguity aversion. In the risk-taking task, participants had to decide whether or not they place a bet, while in the beliefs task, participants were asked what they believed would be the outcome. Unexpectedly, we found that in the beliefs task, participants were not overly pessimistic about the outcome in the ambiguity condition and in fact closer to optimal levels of decision-making than in the risk conditions. While individual differences in pessimism could explain outcome expectancy, they had no effect on ambiguity aversion. Consequently, ambiguity aversion is more likely caused by general caution than by expectation of negative outcomes despite pessimism-dependent subjective weighting of probabilities.},

The development of harmonic tonality creates difficulties for a scientific rationale in so far as tonality, on the one hand, can be regarded as an object of systemic nature, but on the other hand, has emerged historically from the gradual convergence of its constitutive elements. Understanding a system and understanding a historical development call for different strategies of perception and methods of securing scientificity. The tension between these two strategies has a subliminal influence on the nature of Dahlhaus’s Studies on the Origin of Harmonic Tonality since the author succeeds – for the most part subtly – in concealing this tension but ultimately fails to resolve it.},

	abstract = {© David Damschroder 2016. All right reserved. David Damschroder's ongoing reformulation of harmonic theory continues with a dynamic exploration of how Beethoven molded and arranged chords to convey bold conceptions. This book's introductory chapters are organized in the manner of a nineteenth-century Harmonielehre, with individual considerations of the tonal system's key features illustrated by easy-to-comprehend block-chord examples derived from Beethoven's piano sonatas. In the masterworks section that follows, Damschroder presents detailed analyses of movements from the symphonies, piano and violin sonatas, and string quartets, and compares his outcomes with those of other analysts, including William E. Caplin, Robert Gauldin, Nicholas Marston, William J. Mitchell, Frank Samarotto, and Janet Schmalfeldt. Expanding upon analytical practices from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and strongly influenced by Schenkerian principles, this fresh perspective offers a stark contrast to conventional harmonic analysis - both in terms of how Roman numerals are deployed and how musical processes are described in words. Offers a radical rethinking of harmonic analysis, using Beethoven's oeuvre as a case study. Explains what a thorough and penetrating analysis of a musical work might entail and offers critiques of analyses by others. Guides the reader into the world of close analysis through careful demonstrations and explanations of a range of examples.},

Often real-world data sets are predominately composed of "normal" examples with only a small percentage of "abnormal" or "interesting" examples. It is also the case that the cost of misclassifying an abnormal (interesting) example as a normal example is often much higher than the cost of the reverse error. Under-sampling of the majority (nor-mal) class has been proposed as a good means of increasing the sensitivity of a classifier to the minority class. This paper shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority (abnormal) class and under-sampling the majority (normal) class can achieve better classifier performance (in ROC space) than only under-sampling the majority class. This paper also shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority class and under-sampling the majority class can achieve better classifier performance (in ROC space) than varying the loss ratios in Ripper or class priors in Naive Bayes. Our method of over-sampling the minority class involves creating synthetic minority class examples. Experiments are performed using C4.5, Ripper and a Naive Bayes classifier. The method is evaluated using the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC) and the ROC convex hull strategy.},

	abstract = {Experienced listeners internalize musical tonal knowledge via statistical learning of pitch distributions as a result of exposure to musical environment. Cross-cultural studies of music cognition offer new perspectives to investigate the acquisition of tonal schema. Makam music is a rich musical system characterized by modal structures defined by micro-tonal pitch sets, and melodic progression patterns (aka seyir features). Makam schema is possibly acquired by internalizing the seyir in addition to pitch features. In the current study, we examined whether an ideal model of makam schema is built with multidimensional scaling analysis and with self-organizing maps (SOMs). We were interested in whether statistical information about seyir features, in addition to pitch distributions, would form an acceptable makam schema model. We qualitatively analyzed topographical organizations in the models to understand whether they reflect complex relations between makams. Multidimensional scaling analyses did not produce an acceptable model for makam schema. The SOM trained with pitch distributions provided an adequate model for makam schema. However, the SOM trained with both pitch distributions and seyir features was better in capturing the complex relations between makams. Further behavioral research is necessary to understand whether melodic progression patterns are intrinsic features of the tonal knowledge of the experienced listeners of makam music.},

I first apply the mean field approximation to demonstrate that phase transitions occur in this model from disordered sound to discrete sets of pitches, including the 12-fold octave division used in Western music. Beyond the mean field model, I use numerical simulation to uncover emergent structures of musical harmony. These results provide a new lens through which to view the fundamental structures of music and to discover new musical ideas to explore.},

The present study investigated tonal priming for mediants (the third scale degree) over leading tones (the seventh scale degree) presented in melodic contexts. Experiment 1 used a timbre discrimination task and Experiment 2 an intonation task. Facilitated processing was observed for the more tonally stable mediants over the less stable leading tones, thus showing that priming effects are not limited to pairs of tonal degrees including the tonic.

	abstract = {From the seventeenth century to the present day, tonal harmonic music has had a number of invariant properties such as the use of specific chord progressions (cadences) to induce a sense of closure, the asymmetrical privileging of certain progressions, and the privileging of the major and minor scales. The most widely accepted explanation has been that this is due to a process of enculturation: frequently occurring musical patterns are learned by listeners, some of whom become composers and replicate the same patterns, which go on to influence the next “generation” of composers, and so on. In this paper, however, I present a possible psychoacoustic explanation for some important regularities of tonal-harmonic music. The core of the model is two different measures of pitch-based distance between chords. The first is voice-leading distance; the second is spectral pitch distance—a measure of the distance between the partials in one chord compared to those in another chord. I propose that when a pair of triads has a higher spectral distance than another pair of triads that is voice-leading-close, the former pair is heard as an alter},

However, the majority of these models rely on pitch information taken from melody alone. Given the prevalence of homophonic music in Western culture, however, surprisingly little attention has been directed at exploring the predictive power of harmonic accompaniment in models of melodic organization. The research presented here uses a combination of the three main approaches to empirical musicology-exploratory analysis, model-ing, and hypothesis testing-to investigate the influence of harmony on melodic behavior. In this study a comparison is made between models that use only melodic information and models that consider the melodic information along with the underlying harmonic accompaniment to predict melodic continuations. A test of overall performance shows a significant improvement using a melodic-harmonic model. When individual scale degrees are examined, the major diatonic scale degrees are shown to have unique probability distributions for each of their most common harmonic settings. That is, the results suggest a robust effect of harmony on melodic organization. Perceptual implications and directions for future research are discussed.},

The harmonic content of the music was analyzed with both Roman numerals and function labels in duplicate by two different expert analyzers. The pieces are divided into musical phrases, allowing for multiple-levels of automatic analysis, including chord labeling and phrase parsing. This paper describes the content of the dataset in detail, including the types of chords represented, and discusses the ways in which the analyzers sometimes disagreed on the lower-level harmonic content (the Roman numerals) while converging at similar high-level structures (the function of the chords within the phrase).},

	abstract = {One important approach for knowledge discovery and data mining is to estimate unobserved variables because latent variables can indicate hidden specific properties of observed data. The latent factor model assumes that each item in a record has a latent factor; the cooccurrence of items can then be modeled by latent factors. In document modeling, a record indicates a document represented as a “bag of words,” meaning that the order of words is ignored, an item indicates a word and a latent factor indicates a topic. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a widely used Bayesian topic model applying the Dirichlet distribution over the latent topic distribution of a document having multiple topics. LDA assumes that latent topics, i.e., discrete latent variables, are distributed according to a multinomial distribution whose parameters are generated from the Dirichlet distribution. LDA also models a word distribution by using a multinomial distribution whose parameters follows the Dirichlet distribution. This Dirichlet-multinomial setting, however, cannot capture the power-law phenomenon of a word distribution, which is known as Zipf’s law in linguistics. We therefore propose a novel topic model using the Pitman-Yor(PY) process, called the PY topic model. The PY topic model captures two properties of a document; a power-law word distribution and the presence of multiple topics. In an experiment using real data, this model outperformed LDA in document modeling in terms of perplexity},

	abstract = {Within the last fifteen years, the field of Music Information Retrieval (MIR) has made tremendous progress in the development of algorithms for organizing and analyzing the ever-increasing large and varied amount of music and music-related data available digitally. However, the development of content-based methods to enable or improve multimedia retrieval still remains a central challenge. In this perspective paper, we critically look at the problem of automatic chord estimation from audio recordings as a case study of content-based algorithms, and point out several bottlenecks in current approaches: expressiveness and flexibility are obtained to the expense of robustness and vice-versa; available multimodal sources of information are little exploited; modeling multi-faceted and strongly interrelated musical information is limited with current architectures; models are typically restricted to short-term analysis that does not account for the hierarchical temporal structure of musical signals. Dealing with music data requires the ability to handle both uncertainty and complex relational structure at multiple levels of representation. Traditional approaches have generally treated these two aspects separately, probability and learning being the standard way to represent uncertainty in knowledge, while logical representation being the standard way to represent knowledge and complex relational information. We advocate that the identified hurdles of current approaches could be overcome by recent developments in the area of Statistical Relational Artificial Intelligence (StarAI) that unifies probability, logic and (deep) learning.

	abstract = {Cadences, as breaths in music, are felt by the listener or studied by the theorist by combining harmony, melody, texture and possibly other musical aspects. We formalize and discuss the significance of 44 cadential features, correlated with the occurrence of cadences in scores. These features describe properties at the arrival beat of a cadence and its surroundings, but also at other onsets heuristically identified to pinpoint chords preparing the cadence. The representation of each beat of the score as a vector of ca-dential features makes it possible to reformulate cadence detection as a classification task. An SVM classifier was run on two corpora from Bach and Haydn totaling 162 perfect authentic cadences and 70 half cadences. In these corpora , the classifier correctly identified more than 75\% of perfect authentic cadences and 50\% of half cadences, with low false positive rates. The experiment results are consistent with common knowledge that classification is more complex for half cadences than for authentic cadences.},

	abstract = {Tonal music, from a historical perspective, is far from homogenous; yet an enduring feature is a background "diatonic" system of exactly seven notes orderable cyclically by fifth. What is the source of the durability of the diatonic system, the octave of which is representable in terms of two particular integers, namely 12 and 7? And how is this durability consistent with the equally remarkable variety of musical styles — or languages — that the history of Western tonal music has taught us exist? This book is an attempt to answer these questions. Using mathematical tools to describe and explain the Western musical system as a highly sophisticated communication system, this theoretical, historical, and cognitive study is unprecedented in scope and depth. The author engages in intense dialogue with 1000 years of music-theoretical thinking, offering answers to some of the most enduring questions concerning Western tonality. The book is divided into two main parts, both governed by the communicative premise. Part I studies proto-tonality, the background system of notes prior to the selection of a privileged note known as "final." After some preliminaries that concern consonance and chromaticism, Part II begins with the notion "mode." A mode is "dyadic" or "triadic," depending on its "nucleus." Further, a "key" is a special type of "semi-key" which is a special type of mode. Different combinations of these categories account for tonal variety. Ninth-century music, for example, is a tonal language of dyadic modes, while seventeenth-century music is a language of triadic semi-keys. While portions of the book are characterized by abstraction and formal rigor, more suitable for expert readers, it will also be of value to anyone intrigued by the tonal phenomenon at large, including music theorists, musicologists, and music-cognition researchers. The content is supported by a general index, a list of definitions, a list of notation used, and two appendices providing the basic mathematical background.},

Our model relies on a careful analysis of the google-ngram database of books published in the last centuries and its main consequence is the generalization of Zipf's and Heaps' law to two scaling regimes. We confirm that these generalizations yield the best simple description of the data among generic descriptive models and that the two free parameters depend only on the language but not on the database. From the point of view of our model the main change on historical time scales is the composition of the specific words included in the finite list of core-words, which we observe to decay exponentially in time with a rate of approximately 30 words per year for English.},

Both the domains use basic units (e.g., words and notes) to build rule-governed higher order representations (e.g., phrases and melodies). neither language processing nor musical processing proceeds by retrieving ‘already-constructed’ well- formed sentences or melodies from long-term memory. sentences are constructed in real-time processing by putting together constituents. humans can, therefore, understand the meaning of a completely novel sentence, which suggests that language processing proceeds by accessing certain rules, which puts together certain elements from an existing small inventory of primitives. in a similar fashion, music involves production and processing of novel elements combining in a principled manner. studies have shown that such sequences are perceived in a meaningful way (antovi«c 2009, Koelsch 2011). how are these two processes inter-related?},

There are two cultures in the use of statistical modeling to reach conclusions from data. One assumes that the data are generated by a given stochastic data model. The other uses algorithmic models and treats the data mechanism as unknown. The statistical community has been committed to the almost exclusive use of data models. This commitment has led to irrelevant theory, questionable conclusions, and has kept statisticians from working on a large range of interesting current problems. Algorithmic modeling, both in theory and practice, has developed rapidly in fields outside statistics. It can be used both on large complex data sets and as a more accurate and informative alternative to data modeling on smaller data sets. If our goal as a field is to use data to solve problems, then we need to move away from exclusive dependence on data models and adopt a more diverse set of tools.},

Results: Needle aspiration significantly increased the sensitivity of bronchoscopy when added to convention-al methods (from 76 to 91\%; p {\textless} 0.001), primarily resulting from differences in submucosal/peribronchial diseases (68 vs. 90\%; p {\textless} 0.001) and independently from the presence of rapid on-site evaluation; needle aspiration guided by rapid on-site evaluation guaranteed a higher improvement in bronchoscopy sensitivity than conventional needle aspira-tion (98 vs. 84\%, respectively; p = 0.004). Needle aspiration guided by rapid on-site evaluation showed a significantly higher sensitivity than the conventional method (97 vs. 76\%, respectively; p = 0.001). Conclusions: Needle aspiration in-creases the sensitivity of bronchoscopy in diagnosing cen-tral airways malignancies when added to conventional diag-nostic methods, with a further significant improvement when guided by rapid on-site evaluation. Abstract Background: Few prospective studies have evaluated the role of endobronchial needle aspiration in diagnosing cen-tral airways neoplasms. Rapid on-site evaluation has long been used in transbronchial needle aspiration of adenopa-thies and peripheral lesions, but its role in sampling central malignancies has not been substantiated yet. Objectives: In this study we evaluated if endobronchial needle aspiration may increase the sensitivity of bronchoscopy for diagnosing central airways neoplasms when added to conventional di-agnostic methods (forceps biopsy, brushing and bronchial washing), and if rapid on-site evaluation may be beneficial in patients undergoing endobronchial needle aspiration. Methods: 125 patients (77\% males, aged 70 ± 7 years; mean ± SD) with central lung cancers were randomized to undergo bronchoscopy including conventional diagnostic methods},

	abstract = {The discovery of patterns using a minimal set of assumptions constitutes a central challenge in the modeling of polyphonic music and complex streams in general. Skip-grams have been found to be a powerful model for capturing semi-local dependencies in sequences of entities when dependencies may not be directly adjacent (see, for instance , the problems of modeling sequences of words or letters in computational linguistics). Since common skip-grams define locality based on indices, they can only be applied to a single stream of non-overlapping entities. This paper proposes a generalized skipgram model that allows arbitrary cost functions (defining locality), efficient filtering , recursive application (skipgrams over skipgrams), and memory efficient streaming. Further, a sampling mechanism is proposed that flexibly controls runtime and output size. These generalizations and optimizations make it possible to employ skipgrams for the discovery of repeated patterns of close, nonsimultaneous events or notes. The extensions to the skipgram model provided here do not only apply to musical notes but to any list of entities that is monotonic with respect to a given cost function.},

Power laws appear widely in physics, biology, earth and planetary sciences, economics and finance, computer science, demography and the social sciences. For instance, the distributions of the sizes of cities, earthquakes, solar flares, moon craters, wars and people's personal fortunes all appear to follow power laws. The origin of power-law behaviour has been a topic of debate in the scientific community for more than a century. Here we review some of the empirical evidence for the existence of power-law forms and the theories proposed to explain them.},

	title = {Scale-free networks are rare},
	url = {https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.03400.pdf},
	abstract = {A central claim in modern network science is that real-world networks are typically "scale free," meaning that the fraction of nodes with degree k follows a power law, decaying like k −α , often with 2 {\textless} α {\textless} 3. However, empirical evidence for this belief derives from a relatively small number of real-world networks. We test the universality of scale-free structure by applying state-of-the-art statistical tools to a large corpus of nearly 1000 network data sets drawn from social, biological, technological, and informational sources. We fit the power-law model to each degree distribution, test its statistical plausibility, and compare it via a likelihood ratio test to alternative, non-scale-free models, e.g., the log-normal. Across domains, we find that scale-free networks are rare, with only 4\% exhibiting the strongest-possible evidence of scale-free structure and 52\% exhibiting the weakest-possible evidence. Furthermore, evidence of scale-free structure is not uniformly distributed across sources: social networks are at best weakly scale free, while a handful of technological and biological networks can be called strongly scale free. These results undermine the universality of scale-free networks and reveal that real-world networks exhibit a rich structural diversity that will likely require new ideas and mechanisms to explain. Networks are a powerful way to both represent and study the structure of complex systems of all kinds. Examples today are plentiful and include social interactions among individuals, both offline and online, protein or gene interactions in biological organisms, communication between digital computers, and various kinds of transportation networks. Across scientific domains and different types of networks, it is common to encounter the claim that most or all real-world networks are scale free. The precise details of this claim vary across the literature [1-7], but generally agree that a network is scale free if the fraction of nodes with degree k follows a power-law distribution k −α , where α {\textgreater} 1. Some versions of this "scale-free hypothesis" make the requirements stronger, e.g., requiring that α ∈ [2, 3] or that node degrees evolve by the preferential attachment mechanism [8, 9]. Other versions make them weaker, e.g., requiring that the power law holds only in the upper tail [10] or is merely more plausible than a thin-tailed distribution like an exponential or normal [11]. Despite the frequency of these claims, there has been no broad evaluation of the empirical prevalence of scale-free patterns in real-world networks. If networks are in fact universally scale free, then many theoretical results about scale-free networks have broad scientific relevance. For instance, the several mechanisms known to build scale-free networks [3, 8, 9, 12-16] would provide a common basis for understanding network assembly. And, such mechanisms could be used to create realistic synthetic networks for numerical simulations and experiments. Moreover, many studies have investigated how scale-free structure shapes the dynamics of processes run},

	abstract = {Power-law distributions occur in many situations of scientific interest and have significant consequences for our understanding of natural and man-made phenomena. Unfortunately, the detection and characterization of power laws is complicated by the large fluctuations that occur in the tail of the distribution-the part of the distribution representing large but rare events-and by the difficulty of identifying the range over which power-law behavior holds. Commonly used methods for analyzing power-law data, such as least-squares fitting, can produce substantially inaccurate estimates of parameters for power-law distributions , and even in cases where such methods return accurate answers they are still unsatisfactory because they give no indication of whether the data obey a power law at all. Here we present a principled statistical framework for discerning and quantifying power-law behavior in empirical data. Our approach combines maximum-likelihood fitting methods with goodness-of-fit tests based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistic and likelihood ratios. We evaluate the effectiveness of the approach with tests on synthetic data and give critical comparisons to previous approaches. We also apply the proposed methods to twenty-four real-world data sets from a range of different disciplines, each of which has been conjectured to follow a power-law distribution. In some cases we find these conjectures to be consistent with the data, while in others the power law is ruled out.},

	abstract = {Music genre can be hard to describe: many factors are involved, such as style, music technique, and historical context. Some genres even have overlapping characteristics. Looking for a better understanding of how music genres are related to musical harmonic structures, we gathered data about the music chords for thousands of popular Brazilian songs. Here, 'popular' does not only refer to the genre named MPB (Brazilian Popular Music) but to nine different genres that were considered particular to the Brazilian case. The main goals of the present work are to extract and engineer harmonically related features from chords data and to use it to classify popular Brazilian music genres towards establishing a connection between harmonic relationships and Brazilian genres. We also emphasize the generalisation of the method for obtaining the data, allowing for the replication and direct extension of this work. Our final model is a combination of multiple classification trees, also known as the random forest model. We found that features extracted from harmonic elements can satisfactorily predict music genre for the Brazilian case, as well as features obtained from the Spotify API. The variables considered in this work also give an intuition about how they relate to the genres.},

[Patel and Daniele (2003a)][1] introduced the nPVI to music research and it has since been used in a number of studies. In this paper, I present a methodological criticism of the nPVI as applied to music. I discuss the known qualitative features of the nPVI and illustrate the nPVI's fundamental features and assumptions through its application to a number of musical datasets. My principle criticism regards the application of a linear average (the nPVI) to categorical data (rhythmic notation). I argue that that simpler mathematical characterizations, which are more musically intuitive, can capture the same useful information as the nPVI. Specifically, counting the proportion of successive IOIs that are identical accounts for as much as 98\% of variation in nPVIs in musical corpora. I argue that abstract mathematical measures ought to be avoided in preference for more concrete empirical descriptions of specific rhythmic features, and that, rather than focusing on a single measure, multiple measures ought to be used. Finally, I conclude that the usage of nPVI in music research should be limited to specific methodologically justified contexts.

However, recent research indicates that different styles within Western tonal music may follow distinct harmonic syntaxes. The current study investigated whether listeners can adapt their harmonic expectations when listening to different musical styles. In two experiments, listeners were presented with short musical excerpts that primed either rock or classical music, followed by a timbre-matched cadence. Results from both experiments indicated that listeners prefer V-I cadences over bVII-I cadences within a classical context, but that this preference is significantly diminished in a rock context. Our findings provide empirical support for the idea that different musical styles do employ different harmonic syntaxes. Furthermore, listeners are not only sensitive to these differences, but are able to adapt their expectations dep...},

On the other hand, determining compositional authorship through internal factors-through stylistic traits of composers derived from the music itself-is often fraught with errors and biases. One of the underlying assumptions in the field of stylometry is that, while it is difficult for humans to perform a truly unbiased analysis of authorial attribution, computational methods can provide clearer and more objective guidelines than would otherwise be apparent to readers or listeners, and thus might provide corroboration or clues for further investigation. This paper discusses machine-learning approaches for evaluating attribution for compositions by Josquin des Prez. We explore musical characteristics such as melodic sequences, counterpoint motion, rhythmic variability, and other entry measures to search for features inherent to a composer's works or style, and we hope that employing such an approach-one that explicitly states which factors led to the decision-making process-can serve to inform scholars looking at other works and composers.},

For a first study over 300 different compositions of Bach, Han-del, Telemann, Mozart and Haydn were used and from this data set it was shown that even with a few features, the styles of the various composers could be separated with leave-one-out-error rates varying from 4\% to 9\% with the exception of the confusion between Mozart and Haydn which yielded a leave-one-out-error rate of 24\%. A second experiment included 30 fugues from J.S. Bach, W.F. Bach and J.L. Krebs, all of different style and character. With this data set of compositions of undisputed authorship, the F minor fugue for organ, BWV 534 (of which BachÕs authorship is disputed) then was confronted.

	abstract = {One curious aspect of human timing is the organization of rhythmic patterns in small integer ratios. Behavioral and neural research has shown that adjacent time intervals in rhythms tend to be perceived and reproduced as approximate fractions of small numbers (e.g. 3/2). Recent work on iterated learning and reproduction further supports this: given a randomly timed drum pattern to reproduce, participants subconsciously transform it toward small integer ratios. The mechanisms accounting for this ‘attractor’ phenomenon are little understood, but might be explained by combining two theoretical frameworks from psychophysics. The scalar expectancy theory describes time interval perception and reproduction using Weber’s law: just detectable durational differences equal a constant fraction of the reference duration. The notion of categorical perception emphasises the tendency to perceive time intervals in categories, i.e. “short” vs. “long”. In this piece, we put forward the hypothesis that the integer-ratio bias in rhythm perception and production might arise from the interaction of the scalar property of timing with the categorical perception of time intervals, and that neurally it can plausibly be related to oscillatory activity. We support our integrative approach with mathematical derivations to formalise assumptions and provide testable predictions. We present equations to calculate predicted durational ratios by: (i) specifying one (of K) category of ratios, (ii) assuming a scalar timing constant, and (iii) parameterising the relationship between durational categories. Our derivations provide the basis for future computational, behavioural and neurophysiological work to test our model.},

However, until now, no large-scale computational bibliometric analysis of the scientific literature in music psychology has been carried out. This study aims to analyze all published literature from the journals Psychology of Music, Music Perception, and Musicae Scientiae. The retrieved literature comprised a total of 2,089 peer-reviewed articles, 2,632 authors, and 49 countries. Visualization and bibliometric techniques were used to investigate the growth of publications, citation analysis, author and country productivity, collaborations, and research trends. From 1973 to 2017, with a total growth rate of 11\%, there is a clear increase in music psychology research (i.e., number of publications, authors, and collaborations), consistent with the general growth observed in science. The retrieved documents received a total of 33,771 citations (M ¼ 16.17, SD ¼ 26.93), with a median (Q1-Q3) of 7 (2-20). Different bibliometric indicators defined the most relevant authors, countries, and keywords as well as how they relate and collaborate with each other. Differences between the three journals are also discussed. This type of analysis, not without its limitations, can help understand music psychology and identify future directions within the field.},

	abstract = {While Wagner and his music have been studied extensively from musicological and music-theoretical perspectives, recent scientific approaches shed light on perceptual processes implicated in the experience of Wagner's music, yielding important insights into the (re)cognition of musical form. Since findings from such studies are mainly discussed within the realm of music psychology and rarely find their way (back) into musicological discourses, the starting point of the present study is a specific interpretation of form in the "Tristan" Prelude (Prelude to Tristan und Isolde) with a view to engaging in an exchange between music-theoretical and cognitive approaches (such as the theory of conceptual metaphor and image schema theory) to Wagner's music. In his article "Circular form in the 'Tristan' Prelude", Robert P. Morgan developed a new music-analytical approach to studying form in Wagner's music, proposing that the musical form of the Prelude can be understood as a circle. Morgan provides an empirically-tractable hypothesis which was tested in a listening study with 45 participants to investigate the extent to which Morgan's analytical shape is audibly perceived. Contrary to Morgan's circular interpretation of form in the "Tristan" Prelude, the findings of our study suggest the primacy of a different visual figure, the spiral. However, recourse to the analytic discourse suggests that the spiral can be understood as a further development of Morgan's figure of thought, synthesizing representations of the Prelude's repetition and development by capturing its unique coincidence of both linearity and circularity. This approach to understanding the "Tristan" Prelude demonstrates how applying music-theoretical and cognitive science approaches gives rise to a fruitful dialogue for both disciplines.},

	abstract = {Research on the music-language interface has extensively investigated similarities and differences of poetic and musical meter, but largely disregarded melody. Using a measure of melodic structure in music––autocorrelations of sound sequences consisting of discrete pitch and duration values––, we show that individual poems feature distinct and text-driven pitch and duration contours, just like songs and other pieces of music. We conceptualize these recurrent melodic contours as an additional, hitherto unnoticed dimension of parallelistic patterning. Poetic speech melodies are higher order units beyond the level of individual syntactic phrases, and also beyond the levels of individual sentences and verse lines. Importantly, auto-correlation scores for pitch and duration recurrences across stanzas are predictive of how melodious naive listeners perceive the respective poems to be, and how likely these poems were to be set to music by professional composers. Experimentally removing classical parallelistic features characteristic of prototypical poems (rhyme, meter, and others) led to decreased autocorrelation scores of pitches, independent of spoken renditions, along with reduced ratings for perceived melodiousness. This suggests that the higher order parallelistic feature of poetic melody strongly interacts with the other parallelistic patterns of poems. Our discovery of a genuine poetic speech melody has great potential for deepening the understanding of the music-language interface.},

Epidemiologists frequently collect data on multiple categorical variables with the goal of examining associations among these variables. Nevertheless, CA appears to be an underused technique in epidemiology. The objective of this article is to present the utility of CA in an epidemiological context. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING The theory and interpretation of CA in the case of two and more than two variables are illustrated through two examples. RESULTS The outcome from CA is a graphical display of the rows and columns of a contingency table that is designed to permit visualization of the salient relationships among the variable responses in a low-dimensional space. Such a representation reveals a more global picture of the relationships among row-column pairs, which would otherwise not be detected through a pairwise analysis. CONCLUSION When the study variables of interest are categorical, CA is an appropriate technique to explore the relationships among variable response categories and can play a complementary role in analyzing epidemiological data.},

	abstract = {Several authors have observed that rock music sometimes features a kind of independence or ‘divorce’ between melody and harmony. In this article, I examine this phenomenon more systematically than has been done in the past. A good indicator of melodic-harmonic divorce is cases where non-chord-tones in the melody do not resolve by step. I argue that this does occur frequently in rock – often with respect to the local harmony, and sometimes with respect to the underlying tonic harmony as well. This melodic-harmonic ‘divorce’ tends to occur in rather specific circumstances: usually in pentatonically based melodies, and in verses rather than choruses. Such situations could be said to reflect a ‘stratified’ pitch organisation. A particularly common situation is where the verse of a song features stratified organisation, followed by a chorus which shifts to a ‘unified’ organisation in which both melody and accompaniment are regulated by the harmonic structure.},

Significant differences in response times were found that depended on click position in relation to the boundary; participants were faster in detecting clicks at constituent boundaries, and slower for clicks located before boundaries, with no effect of rhythmic factors.

However, corpus frequencies may change for a wide variety of reasons, including purely random sampling effects, or because corpora are composed of contemporary media and fiction texts within which the underlying topics ebb and flow with cultural and socio-political trends. In this work, we introduce a computationally simple model for controlling for topical fluctuations in corpora - the topical-cultural advection model - and demonstrate how it provides a robust baseline of variability in word frequency changes over time. We validate the model on a diachronic corpus spanning two centuries, and a carefully-controlled artificial language change scenario, and then use it to correct for topical fluctuations in historical time series. Finally, we show that the model can be used to show that emergence of new words typically corresponds with the rise of a trending topic. This suggests that some lexical innovations occur due to growing communicative need in a subspace of the lexicon, and that the topical-cultural advection model can be used to quantify this.},

However, Franz Liszt, one of the main virtuosos in music history, was convinced that what matters in virtuosity is its specific function within the semantic and communicative processing of music. This article proposes a theoretical framework to further investigate Liszt’s intuitions in light of contemporary research on musical meaning and communication. First, we analyze philological data concerning Liszt’s creative process in the Mazeppa works, a set of works including both his virtuoso and program music. Second, we compare our results with recent research on music semantics based on inferential processes about the composer/performer’s intentions (Antović, Stamenković, \& Figar, 2016; Schlenker, 2017).

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a condition characterized by the gradual loss of kidney function over time. Self-management programs have been widely applied to chronic disease education programs, which are designed to delay deteriorating kidney functions, preclude depression, and improve quality of life. This study aims to analyze effectiveness of self-management programs in bettering CKD patients' eGFR, mitigating depression symptoms and improving quality of life in randomized control or clinical trials. METHODS: Using key terms, a search was conducted in English-language, peer-reviewed journals on CKD that were published between 2002 and 2014 on databases including CINAHL, Cochrane Library, MEDLINE. The measurable variables included CKD patients' eGFR, depression, and quality of life. Random and fixed effects meta analysis were applied with standard error and correlation based measure of effect size. RESULTS: Eight studies met the inclusion criteria. A self-management program significantly impacted CKD patients' depression and mental quality-of-life dimensions, with an effect size of .29 [95\% confidence interval (CI) (0.07, 0.53)] and -.42 [95\% CI (-0.75, -0.10)]. However, the intervention of a self-management program had no significant effect on patients' eGFR as well as physical quality-of-life dimensions, with effect sizes of .06 [95\% CI (-0.69, 0.81)] and -.16 [95\% CI (-0.81, 0.50)]. CONCLUSIONS: Self-management programs of patients with chronic kidney disease can improve the depression and mental quality of life. Aside from providing more objective evidence-based results, this study provides a reference for clinical health care personnel who tend to patients with CKD.},

	abstract = {This article examines some manifestations of Zipf's Law in music. This law describes the frequency of occurrence of events within a phenomenon. This article proposes the use of Zipf-based metrics as a basis for author- and style-identification tasks and for the assessment of aesthetic properties of music pieces. The experimental results in author-identification tasks, where an average success rate of more than 94 percent was attained, show that the used set of metrics, and accordingly Zipf's Law, capture meaningful information about the music pieces. Clearly, the success of this approach does not imply that other metrics or approaches are irrelevant. As noticed by several researchers, culturally sanctioned music tends to exhibit near-ideal Zipf distributions across various parameters. This suggests the possibility that combinations of Zipf-based metrics may represent certain necessary but not sufficient conditions for aesthetically pleasing music. This is supported by our pleasantness study where an artificial neural network (ANN) succeeds in predicting human aesthetic judgments of unknown pieces with more than 98 percent accuracy. It should be emphasized that the metrics proposed in this article offer a particular description of the musical pieces, where traditional musical structures such as motives, tonal structures, etc., are not measured explicitly. Statistical measurements, such as Zipf's Law, tend to focus on general trends and thus can miss significant details.},

	abstract = {Power-law distributions occur in many situations of scientific interest and have significant consequences for our understanding of natural and man-made phenomena. Unfortunately, the detection and characterization of power laws is complicated by the large fluctuations that occur in the tail of the distribution-the part of the distribution representing large but rare events-and by the difficulty of identifying the range over which power-law behavior holds. Commonly used methods for analyzing power-law data, such as least-squares fitting, can produce substantially inaccurate estimates of parameters for power-law distributions, and even in cases where such methods return accurate answers they are still unsatisfactory because they give no indication of whether the data obey a power law at all. Here we present a principled statistical framework for discerning and quantifying power-law behavior in empirical data. Our approach combines maximum-likelihood fitting methods with goodness-of-fit tests based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic and likelihood ratios. We evaluate the effectiveness of the approach with tests on synthetic data and give critical comparisons to previous approaches. We also apply the proposed methods to twenty-four real-world data sets from a range of different disciplines, each of which has been conjectured to follow a power-law distribution. In some cases we find these conjectures to be consistent with the data while in others the power law is ruled out.},

(Rimas NorvaiAa, Mathematical Reviews, Issue 2007 f) Product Description This is a graduate level textbook on measure theory and probability theory. The book can be used as a text for a two semester sequence of courses in measure theory and probability theory, with an option to include supplemental material on stochastic processes and special topics. It is intended primarily for first year Ph.D. students in mathematics and statistics although mathematically advanced students from engineering and economics would also find the book useful. Prerequisites are kept to the minimal level of an understanding of basic real analysis concepts such as limits, continuity, differentiability, Riemann integration, and convergence of sequences and series. A review of this material is included in the appendix. The book starts with an informal introduction that provides some heuristics into the abstract concepts of measure and integration theory, which are then rigorously developed. The first part of the book can be used for a standard real analysis course for both mathematics and statistics Ph.D. students as it provides full coverage of topics such as the construction of Lebesgue-Stieltjes measures on real line and Euclidean spaces, the basic convergence theorems, L p spaces, signed measures, Radon-Nikodym theorem, Lebesgue's decomposition theorem and the fundamental theorem of Lebesgue integration on R, product spaces and product measures, and Fubini-Tonelli theorems. It also provides an elementary introduction to Banach and Hilbert spaces, convolutions, Fourier series and Fourier and Plancherel transforms. Thus part I would be particularly useful for students in a typical Statistics Ph.D. program if a separate course on real analysis is not a standard requirement. Part II (chapters 6-13) provides full coverage of standard graduate level probability theory. It starts with Kolmogorov's probability model and Kolmogorov's existence theorem. It then treats thoroughly the laws of large numbers including renewal theory and ergodic theorems with applications and then weak convergence of probability distributions, characteristic functions, the Levy-Cramer continuity theorem and the central limit theorem as well as stable laws. It ends with conditional expectations and conditional probability, and an introduction to the theory of discrete time martingales. Part III (chapters 14-18) provides a modest coverage of discrete time Markov chains with countable and general state spaces, MCMC, continuous time discrete space jump Markov processes, Brownian motion, mixing sequences, bootstrap methods, and branching processes. It could be used for a topics/seminar course or as an introduction to stochastic processes.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Zipf's law and Heaps' law are observed in disparate complex systems. Of particular interests, these two laws often appear together. Many theoretical models and analyses are performed to understand their co-occurrence in real systems, but it still lacks a clear picture about their relation. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS We show that the Heaps' law can be considered as a derivative phenomenon if the system obeys the Zipf's law. Furthermore, we refine the known approximate solution of the Heaps' exponent provided the Zipf's exponent. We show that the approximate solution is indeed an asymptotic solution for infinite systems, while in the finite-size system the Heaps' exponent is sensitive to the system size. Extensive empirical analysis on tens of disparate systems demonstrates that our refined results can better capture the relation between the Zipf's and Heaps' exponents. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE The present analysis provides a clear picture about the relation between the Zipf's law and Heaps' law without the help of any specific stochastic model, namely the Heaps' law is indeed a derivative phenomenon from the Zipf's law. The presented numerical method gives considerably better estimation of the Heaps' exponent given the Zipf's exponent and the system size. Our analysis provides some insights and implications of real complex systems. For example, one can naturally obtained a better explanation of the accelerated growth of scale-free networks.},

The methodological framework uses concepts from mathematics and psychology (eg convexity and entropy) that allow precise characterisations of the empirical results.In the first experiment, twenty-nine participants performed an identification task with 66 rhythmic stimuli (a systematic sampling of the performance space).

The eigenprogression transform combines ideas from the spiral scattering transform, spectral graph theory, and wavelet shrinkage denoising.

While much has been written about the origin and evolution of pop, most claims about its history are anecdotal rather than scientific in nature. To rectify this, we investigate the US Billboard Hot 100 between 1960 and 2010. Using music information retrieval and text-mining tools, we analyse the musical properties of approximately 17 000 recordings that appeared in the charts and demonstrate quantitative trends in their harmonic and timbral properties. We then use these properties to produce an audio-based classification of musical styles and study the evolution of musical diversity and disparity, testing, and rejecting, several classical theories of cultural change. Finally, we investigate whether pop musical evolution has been gradual or punctuated. We show that, although pop music has evolved continuously, it did so with particular rapidity during three stylistic ‘revolutions’ around 1964, 1983 and 1991. We conclude by discussing how our study points the way to a quantitative science of cultural change.},

	abstract = {Music exhibits structure at multiple scales, ranging from motifs to large-scale functional components. When inferring the structure of a piece, different listeners may attend to different temporal scales, which can result in disagreements when they describe the same piece. In the field of music informatics research (MIR), it is common to use corpora annotated with structural boundaries at different levels. By quantifying disagreements between multiple annotators, previous research has yielded several insights relevant to the study of music cognition. First, annotators tend to agree when structural boundaries are ambiguous. Second, this ambiguity seems to depend on musical features, time scale, and genre. Furthermore, it is possible to tune current annotation evaluation metrics to better align with these perceptual differences. However, previous work has not directly analyzed the effects of hierarchical structure because the existing methods for comparing structural annotations are designed for "flat" descriptions, and do not readily generalize to hierarchical annotations. In this paper, we extend and generalize previous work on the evaluation of hierarchical descriptions of musical structure. We derive an evaluation metric which can compare hierarchical annotations holistically across multiple levels. sing this metric, we investigate inter-annotator agreement on the multilevel annotations of two different music corpora, investigate the influence of acoustic properties on hierarchical annotations, and evaluate existing hierarchical segmentation algorithms against the distribution of inter-annotator agreement.},

Vivaldi, who almost invariably placed his arias in a contrasting key, was a leading exponent of this technique and employed a surprisingly large variety of key relationships at the recitative–aria interface.

Priors for cultural artifacts such as music and language remain largely uncharacterized, but likely constrain cultural transmission, because only those signals with high probability under the prior can be reliably reproduced and communicated. We developed a method to estimate priors for simple rhythms via iterated reproduction of random temporal sequences. Listeners were asked to reproduce random "seed" rhythms; their reproductions were fed back as the stimulus and over time became dominated by internal biases, such that the prior could be estimated by applying the procedure multiple times. We validated that the measured prior was consistent across the modality of reproduction and that it correctly predicted perceptual discrimination. We then measured listeners' priors over the entire space of two- and three-interval rhythms. Priors in US participants showed peaks at rhythms with simple integer ratios and were similar for musicians and non-musicians. An analogous procedure produced qualitatively different results for spoken phrases, indicating some specificity to music. Priors measured in members of a native Amazonian society were distinct from those in US participants but also featured integer ratio peaks. The results do not preclude biological constraints favoring integer ratios, but they suggest that priors on musical rhythm are substantially modulated by experience and may simply reflect the empirical distribution of rhythm that listeners encounter. The proposed method can efficiently map out a high-resolution view of biases that shape transmission and stability of simple reproducible patterns within a culture.},

This paper presents a number of counterarguments that emphasize the importance of continuing research in automatic genre classification. Specific strategies for overcoming current performance limitations are discussed, and a brief review of background research in musicology and psychology relating to genre is presented.

As collocations have found many applications in the fields of natural language processing, information retrieval, and text mining, extracting them from large corpora has been the focus of many studies over the past few years. In this paper, we introduce the notion of an extension pattern, a formalization of the idea of extending lexical association measures (AMs) defined for bigrams. An extension pattern provides a measure-independent way of extending AMs for extracting collocations of arbitrary length. We define different extension patterns and compare them on a task of extracting collocations from a newspaper corpus. We show that the stopword-sensitive extension patterns we propose outperform other extensions, which indicates that AMs could benefit by taking into account linguistic information about an n-gram's part-of-speech pattern.},

	abstract = {Chord recognition systems typically comprise an acoustic model that predicts chords for each audio frame, and a temporal model that casts these predictions into labelled chord segments. However, temporal models have been shown to only smooth predictions, without being able to incorporate musical information about chord progressions. Recent research discovered that it might be the low hierarchical level such models have been applied to (directly on audio frames) which prevents learning musical relationships, even for expressive models such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs). However, if applied on the level of chord sequences, RNNs indeed can become powerful chord predictors. In this paper, we disentangle temporal models into a harmonic language model-to be applied on chord sequences-and a chord duration model that connects the chord-level predictions of the language model to the frame-level predictions of the acoustic model. In our experiments, we explore the impact of each model on the chord recognition score, and show that using harmonic language and duration models improves the results.},

I propose that mathematical modelling of certain kinds may be appropriate to model certain musical relationships, but this is so because of underlying cognitive princi- ples. The conclusion is that to model music mathematically is essentially to model (parts of) cognition mathematically, which means that to model music in the abstract, as though it were itself a mathematical construct, divorced from its source in the human mind, is misleading. For a true understanding, the power of mathematics should be applied to the process of musical behaviour, not merely to its product. That process lies in the embodied human mind. Keywords:},

Key signatures are modelled by signature vectors, i.e. seven-dimensional vectors with integer coordinates, each coordinate indicating the number of sharps (+) or flats (−) assigned to one of the seven letter names. A definition of standard signature vectors (those corresponding to the usual key signature of some major key) is readily formulated. These constructions do not depend on any convention regarding enharmonic equivalence of note names, but enharmonic equivalence (EE) conditions are intimately connected with key signatures, and in fact may also be formalized in terms of signature vectors, called in this context EE vectors. The canonical EE vector gives rise to a familiar twelve-note enharmonic system, but other systems are possible. Connections with maximal evenness and other properties familiar in diatonic set theory are investigated. The usual staff notation, inc...},

The previous findings are reconsidered using non-Western listeners (traditional healers from South Africa) in a modeling investigation. Comparison of different models made it possible to separate the role of data-driven and schema-driven models in melodic expectancies and to reveal any possible Western bias in previous studies. The results of the experiment, in which African listeners rated the fitness of probe-tones as continuations of North Sami yoik excerpts, indicated that data-driven models are adequate in explaining the expectancies, regardless of the cultural background of the listeners. The frequency-based models exerted more influence on listeners unfamiliar with the yoik style, the Western schematic model had most impact on Western listeners, and the style-specific models carried most predictive power for those listeners who possessed knowledge about yoiks. © 2009 by ESCOM European Society for the Cognitive Sciences of Music.},

These statistics, called expectancies, are found in music perception, and they span a variety of different features and time scales. Specifically, there is evidence that music perception involves strong expectancies regarding the distribution of a melodic interval, namely, the distance between two consecutive notes within the context of another. The recent availability of a large Western music dataset, consisting of the historical record condensed as melodic interval counts, has opened new possibilities for data-driven analysis of musical perception. In this context, we present an analytical approach that, based on cognitive theories of music expectation and machine learning techniques, recovers a set of factors that accurately identifies historical trends and stylistic transitions between the Baroque, Classical, Romantic, and Post-Romantic periods. We also offer a plausible musicological and cognitive interpretation of these factors, allowing us to propose them as data-driven principles of melodic expectation.},

Students save their own annotated slides for subsequent review. They also have immediate access to the synchronized screen capture and audio recording of the class since the instructor posts this file to the course management website. These technological interventions allow students to focus on classroom activities rather than on note-taking. To date, students have taken three introductory undergraduate mathematics courses (College Algebra and Trigonometry, Calculus I, and Calculus II) using Tablet PCs. Student attendance and retention were better in the cohort of students who participated in the Tablet PC courses than in comparable non-Tablet PC courses taught by the same instructor.

We describe the nature of the statistical test as it is realized with a vector retrieval methodology based on the cosine coefficient of document-document similarity. As an example, this tech nique is then applied to a large MEDLINE " subset in the area of biotechnology. The initial processing of this datahase involves a 310 word stop list of common non-content terms. Our technique is then applied and 75\% of the remaining terms are identified as stop words. We compare retrieval with and without the removal of these stop words and find that of the top twenty documents retrieved in response to a random query document. seventeen of these are the same on the average for the two methods We also examine the differences and conclude that where the user prefers one method over the other, the new method with the reduced term set is favored about three times out of four.},

That means we’ve attempted to be ridiculously explicit in our exposition and notation. After providing the reasons and reasoning behind Gibbs sampling (and at least nodding our heads in the direction of theory), we work through two applications in detail. The first is the derivation of a Gibbs sampler for Naive Bayes models, which illustrates a simple case where the math works out very cleanly and it’s possible to “integrate out” the model’s continuous parameters to build a more efficient algorithm. The second application derives the Gibbs sampler for a model that is similar to Naive Bayes, but which adds an additional latent variable. Having gone through the two examples, we discuss some practical implementation issues. We conclude with some pointers to literature that we’ve found to be somewhat more friendly to uninitiated readers.},

	abstract = {© 2018 The New York Academy of Sciences. Music perception depends on internal psychological models derived through exposure to a musical culture. It is hypothesized that this musical enculturation depends on two cognitive processes: (1) statistical learning, in which listeners acquire internal cognitive models of statistical regularities present in the music to which they are exposed; and (2) probabilistic prediction based on these learned models that enables listeners to organize and process their mental representations of music. To corroborate these hypotheses, I review research that uses a computational model of probabilistic prediction based on statistical learning (the information dynamics of music (IDyOM) model) to simulate data from empirical studies of human listeners. The results show that a broad range of psychological processes involved in music perception-expectation, emotion, memory, similarity, segmentation, and meter-can be understood in terms of a single, underlying process of probabilistic prediction using learned statistical models. Furthermore, IDyOM simulations of listeners from different musical cultures demonstrate that statistical learning can plausibly predict causal effects of differential cultural exposure to musical styles, providing a quantitative model of cultural distance. Understanding the neural basis of musical enculturation will benefit from close coordination between empirical neuroimaging and computational modeling of underlying mechanisms, as outlined here.},

Authentic and half cadences not only serve as structural cornerstones of tonal music, but are readily perceived by both expert and novice listeners. Yet it is unclear how untrained listeners, who have never studied harmonic theory, come to recognise cadential patterns that are most often codified as short series of chords, such as V7–I or ii6–V. This study addresses both questions by analysing a corpus of string-quartet excerpts whose authentic and half cadences were identified by two musical experts. A cognitively plausible model of harmonic learning, which is based on clusters of scale-degree distributions abstracted from the data, is proposed. After assessing the correlation of this model’s output with cadential categories, Bayesian or near-Bayesian frameworks are used to learn these categories from the model in both supervised and unsupervised contexts. The model succeeds in not only spotting cadences but also identifying cadential categories from unlabelled data. The model’s relationship to relevant perceptual research, as well as the results’ implications for human learning and detection of cadences, is discussed.},

Today, as over two billion people create global " digital culture " by sharing their photos, video, links, writing posts, comments, ratings, etc., we can also use the same methods to study this universe of contemporary digital culture. In this chapter I will discuss a number of issues regarding the " shape " of the digital visual collections we have, from the point of view of researchers who use computational methods. They are working today in many fields including computer science, computational sociology, digital art history, digital humanities, digital heritage and Cultural Analytics – which is the term I introduced in 2007 to refer to all of this research, and also to a particular research program of our own lab that has focused on exploring large visual collections. Regardless of what analytical methods are used in this research, the analysis has to start with some concrete existing data. The " shapes " of existing digital collections may enable some research directions and make others more difficult. So what is the data universe cre-ated by digitization, what does it make possible, and also impossible? The Islands and The Ocean Before born-digital content, media creators first used physical and later electronic media (video and audio). Starting in the middle 1990s, gradually more and more of this content has being digitized. We can call such content born-analog. The very first project to digitize cultural texts and make them freely available was Pro-ject Gutenberg that started in 1970. Today the largest sites for digitized content include Europeana (over 53 milion " artworks, artefacts, books, videos, and sounds from across},

The present experiments aimed to determine whether listeners actually perceive such rhythmic differences in a purely musical context (i.e., in instrumental music without words). In Experiment 1a, listeners successfully classified instrumental renditions of French and English songs having highly contrastive rhythmic differences. Experiment 1b replicated this result with the same songs containing rhythmic information only. In Experiments 2a and 2b, listeners successfully classified original and rhythm-only stimuli when language-specific rhythmic differences were less contrastive but more representative of differences found in actual music and speech. These findings indicate that listeners can use rhythmic similarities and differences to classify songs originally composed in two languages having contrasting rhythmic prosody.},

	abstract = {AbstractIn this article, we propose a solution to the problem of query by example for polyphonic music audio.We first present a generic mid-level representation for audio queries. Unlike previous efforts in the literature, the proposed representation is not dependent on the different spectral characteristics of different musical instruments and the accurate location of note onsets and offsets. This is achieved by first mapping the short term frequency spectrum of consecutive audio frames to the musical space (The Spiral Array) and defining a tonal identity with respect to center of effect that is generated by the spectral weights of the musical notes. We then use the resulting single dimensional text representations of the audio to create n-gram statistical sequence models to track the tonal characteristics and the behavior of the pieces. After performing appropriate smoothing, we build a collection of melodic n-gram models for testing. Using perplexity-based scoring, we test the likelihood of a sequence of lexical chords (an audio query) given each model in the database collection. Initial results show that, some variations of the input piece appears in the top 5 results 81\% of the time for whole melody inputs within a 500 polyphonic melody database. We also tested the retrieval engine for small audio clips. Using 25s segments, variations of the input piece are among the top 5 results 75\% of the time.},

This paper seeks to address this gap, by providing a systematic analysis of factors which character-ize the LDA's performance. We present theorems elucidating the posterior contraction rates of the topics as the amount of data increases, and a thor-ough supporting empirical study using synthetic and real data sets, including news and web-based articles and tweet messages.

	abstract = {Several decades of research in the field of machine learning have resulted in a multitude of different algorithms for solving a broad range of problems. To tackle a new application, a researcher typically tries to map their problem onto one of these existing methods, often influenced by their familiarity with specific algorithms and by the availability of corresponding software implementations. In this study, we describe an alternative methodology for applying machine learning, in which a bespoke solution is formulated for each new application. The solution is expressed through a compact modelling language, and the corresponding custom machine learning code is then generated automatically. This model-based approach offers several major advantages, including the opportunity to create highly tailored models for specific scenarios, as well as rapid prototyping and comparison of a range of alternative models. Furthermore, newcomers to the field of machine learning do not have to learn about the huge range of traditional methods, but instead can focus their attention on understanding a single modelling environment. In this study, we show how probabilistic graphical models, coupled with efficient inference algorithms, provide a very flexible foundation for model-based machine learning, and we outline a large-scale commercial application of this framework involving tens of millions of users. We also describe the concept of probabilistic programming as a powerful software environment for model-based machine learning, and we discuss a specific probabilistic programming language called Infer.NET, which has been widely used in practical applications.},

However, Bayes, in his theorem, used uniform priors [1]. Pierre-Simon Laplace (1749–1827), shown in the lower right corner of Figure 1, apparently unaware of Bayes' work, dis-covered the same theorem in more general form in a memoir he wrote at the age of 25 and showed its wide applicability [2]. Regarding these issues S.M. Stiegler writes: The influence of this memoir was immense. It was from here that " Bayesian " ideas first spread through the mathematical world, as Bayes's own article was ignored until 1780 and played no important role in scientific debate until the 20th century. It was also this article of Laplace's that introduced the mathematical techniques for the asymptotic analysis of poste-rior distributions that are still employed today. And it was here that the earliest example of optimum estimation can be found, the deriva-tion and characterization of an estimator that minimized a particular measure of posterior expected loss. After more than two centuries, we mathematicians, statisticians cannot only recognize our roots in this masterpiece of our science, we can still learn from it.

IEEE SIGNAL PROCESSING MAGAZINE [132] NOVEMBER 2008 IEEE SIGNAL PROCESSING MAGAZINE [132] NOVEMBER 2008 Maximum likelihood (ML) estimation is one of the most popular methodologies used in modern statistical signal pro-cessing. The expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is an iterative algorithm for ML estimation that has a number of advantages and has become a standard methodology for solv-ing statistical signal processing problems. However, the EM algorithm has certain requirements that seriously limit its applicability to complex problems. Recently, a new methodol-ogy termed " variational Bayesian inference " has emerged, which relaxes some of the limiting requirements of the EM algorithm and is gaining rapidly popularity. Furthermore, one can show that the EM algorithm can be viewed as a special case of this methodology. In this article, we first present a tutorial introduction of Bayesian variational inference aimed at the signal processing community. We use linear regression and Gaussian mixture modeling as examples to demonstrate the additional capabilities that Bayesian variational inference offers as compared to the EM algorithm.},

And music is ancient. The oldest known musical instruments appear in the archaeological record from 40,000 years ago (40 Kya) and from these we can infer even earlier musical artefacts/activities, as yet unrepresented in the archaeological record. I argue that, following research couched in the social brain hypothesis framework, a theoretical basis is emerging for the proposition that the (incremental) evolution of proto-music took hold in the late mid-Pleistocene, roughly 400 Kya, and perhaps earlier. Subsequently, musical activities and traditions incrementally evolved throughout modernity (from 250 Kya onwards), global dispersal from Africa (currently thought to be from 60-100 Kya onwards), and the Holocene (from 12 Kya).

	abstract = {Popular music is a key cultural expression that has captured listeners' attention for ages. Many of the structural regularities underlying musical discourse are yet to be discovered and, accordingly, their historical evolution remains formally unknown. Here we unveil a number of patterns and metrics characterizing the generic usage of primary musical facets such as pitch, timbre, and loudness in contemporary western popular music. Many of these patterns and metrics have been consistently stable for a period of more than fifty years. However, we prove important changes or trends related to the restriction of pitch transitions, the homogenization of the timbral palette, and the growing loudness levels. This suggests that our perception of the new would be rooted on these changing characteristics. Hence, an old tune could perfectly sound novel and fashionable, provided that it consisted of common harmonic progressions, changed the instrumentation, and increased the average loudness. I sn't it always the same? This question could be easily posed while listening to the music of any mainstream radio station in a western country. Like language, music is a human universal involving perceptually discrete elements displaying organization 1 . Therefore, contemporary popular music may have a well-established set of underlying patterns and regularities 1–4 , some of them potentially inherited from the classical tradition 5–7 . Yet, as an incomparable artistic product for conveying emotions 8 , music must incorporate variation over such patterns in order to play upon people's memories and expectations, making it attractive to listeners 3–5 . For the very same reasons, long-term variations of the underlying patterns may also occur across years 9 . Many of these aspects remain formally unknown or lack scientific evidence, specially the latter, which is very often neglected in music-related studies, from musicological analyses to technological applications. The study of patterns and long-term variations in popular music could shed new light on relevant issues concerning its organization, structure, and dynamics 10 . More importantly, it addresses valuable questions for the basic understanding of music as one of the main expressions of contemporary culture: Can we identify some of the patterns behind music creation? Do musicians change them over the years? Can we spot differences between new and old music? Is there an 'evolution' of musical discourse? Current technologies for music information processing 11,12 provide a unique opportunity to answer the above questions under objective, empirical, and quantitative premises.

The technique is a variation of Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (Hinton and Roweis, 2002) that is much easier to optimize, and produces significantly better visualizations by reducing the tendency to crowd points together in the center of the map. t-SNE is better than existing techniques at creating a single map that reveals structure at many different scales. This is particularly important for high-dimensional data that lie on several different, but related, low-dimensional manifolds, such as images of objects from multiple classes seen from multiple viewpoints. For visualizing the structure of very large data sets, we show how t-SNE can use random walks on neighborhood graphs to allow the implicit structure of all of the data to influence the way in which a subset of the data is displayed. We illustrate the performance of t-SNE on a wide variety of data sets and compare it with many other non-parametric visualization techniques, including Sammon mapping, Isomap, and Locally Linear Embedding. The visualiza-tions produced by t-SNE are significantly better than those produced by the other techniques on almost all of the data sets.},

Our findings demonstrate that (1) terminal events from cadential contexts are more predictable than those from non-cadential contexts; (2) models of cadential strength advanced in contemporary cadence typologies reflect the formation of schematic expectations; and (3) a significant decrease in predictability follows the terminal note and chord events of the cadential formula.},

However, detailed accounts of what is meant by these terms are sparse in the literature. We argue for distinguishing two notions: "size range," which deals with physical size, and "collectivity," which deals with aggregations of individuals into collections, which have emergent properties and effects. We further distinguish these notions from "specialisation," "degree of detail," "density," and "connectivity." We argue that the notion of "collectivity"-molecules in water, cells in tissues, people in crowds, stars in galaxies-has been neglected but is a key to representing biological notions, that it is a pervasive notion across size ranges-micro, macro, cosmological, etc.-and that it provides an account of a number of troublesome issues including the most important cases of when the biomedical notion of parthood is, or is not, best represented by a transitive relation. Although examples are taken from biomedicine, we believe these notions to have wider application. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Using this approach, a successful visual clustering of music is possible for 1) composers through various musical time periods, and 2) the three periods of Beethoven, which illustrates the use of our approach on both a general and a specific level. Furthermore, we will see that automatic classification between tonal and atonal music can be achieved.},

Specifically, we present an application to information retrieval in which documents are modeled as paths down a random tree, and the preferential attachment dynamics of the nCRP leads to clustering of documents according to sharing of topics at multiple levels of abstraction. Given a corpus of documents, a posterior inference algorithm finds an approximation to a posterior distribution over trees, topics and allocations of words to levels of the tree. We demonstrate this algorithm on collections of scientific abstracts from several journals. This model exemplifies a recent trend in statistical machine learning--the use of Bayesian nonparametric methods to infer distributions on flexible data structures.},

This corpus is based on data from classicalarchives.com, a repository of thousands of usergenerated MIDI representations of pieces from several periods of Western European music history. The YCAC makes available metadata for each MIDI file, as well as a list of pitch simultaneities ("salami slices") in the MIDI file. Metadata include the piece's composer, the composer's country of origin, date of composition, genre (e.g., symphony, piano sonata, nocturne, etc.), instrumentation, meter, and key. The processing step groups the file's pitches into vertical slices each time a pitch is added or subtracted from the texture, recording the slice's offset (measured in the number of quarter notes separating the event from the file's beginning), highest pitch, lowest pitch, prime form, scale-degrees in relation to the global key (as determined by experts), and local key information (as determined by a windowed key-profile analysis). The corpus contains 13,769 MIDI files by 571 composers yielding over 14,051,144 vertical slices.

These three collections will be referred to as the diatonic sets. Several new terms are introduced to facilitate the application of pitch-class set theory to descriptions of tonal pitch relations and to retain characteristic intervallic relationships in tonal music typically not found in discussions of atonal pitch-class relations. The description comprises three parts. First, pitch sets are converted to pitch-class sets. Second, the pitch-class sets are categorized by transpositional types. Third, the relations of these transpositional types are described in terms of their key center and modal references to the three diatonic sets. Further, it is suggested that the probability of a specific key interpretation by a listener may depend on the scale-degree functions of the tones.},

Slightly more than half of listeners' judgments matched the generating keys, on both the untimed and the timed conditions.

Several studies, inspired by research on the statistical learning of language, have investigated statistical learning of sequential rules underlying tone sequences. Given that the mental representation of music correlates with distributional properties of music, we tested whether participants are able to abstract distributional information contained in tone sequences to form a mental representation. For this purpose, we created an unfamiliar music genre defined by an underlying tone distribution, to which 40 participants were exposed. Our stimuli allowed us to differentiate between sensitivity to the distributional properties contained in test stimuli and long term representation of the distributional properties of the music genre overall. Using a probe tone paradigm and a two-alternative forced choice discrimination task, we show that listeners are able to abstract distributional properties of music through mere exposure into a long term representation of music. This lends support to the idea that statistical learning is involved in the process of gaining musical knowledge.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an automatic harmonization method that, for a given melody (sequence of musical notes), gen-erates a sequence of chord symbols in the style of exist-ing data. A typical way is to use hidden Markov models (HMMs) that represent chord transitions on a regular grid (e.g., bar or beat grid). This approach, however, cannot explicitly describe the rhythms, harmonic functions (e.g., tonic, dominant, and subdominant), and the hierarchical structure of chords, which are supposedly important in tra-ditional harmony theories. To solve this, we formulate a hi-erarchical generative model consisting of (1) a probabilis-tic context-free grammar (PCFG) for chords incorporating their syntactic functions, (2) a metrical Markov model de-scribing chord rhythms, and (3) a Markov model generat-ing melodies conditionally on a chord sequence. To esti-mate a variable-length chord sequence for a given melody, we iteratively refine the latent tree structure and the chord symbols and rhythms using a Metropolis-Hastings sampler with split-merge operations. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperformed the HMM-based method in terms of predictive abilities.},

One of these issues is the monotonic increase of the corpus size with time and the other one is the presence of noise in the textual data. In addition, our method allows to better target the linguistic evolution of the corpus, instead of other aspects like noise fluctuation or topics evolution. A corpus formed by two newspapers, "La Gazette de Lausanne" and "Le Journal de Gen{\textbackslash}`eve", is used, providing 4 million articles from 200 years of archives. We first perform some classical measurements on this corpus in order to provide indicators and visualizations of linguistic evolution. We then define the concept of a lexical kernel and word resilience, to face the two challenges of noises and corpus size fluctuations. This paper ends with a discussion based on the comparison of results from linguistic change analysis and a concludes with possible future works continuing in that direction.},

Although musical training and invariance of surface melodic and rhythmic features were found to have an advantageous effect on the identification task, even some non-musicians were able to identify music from chord progressions in conditions of low invariance of surface features.

	abstract = {We explored the relationship between musical structure and emotion on different variations of La Folia – a musical theme of Portuguese origin based on a standard harmonic progression. Our approach aims to extend previous research by investigating more factors and comparing different models for music emotion. In a pilot study, 12 participants rated the emotion associated to the stimuli on a graduate scale from 1 to 10, according to 3 different models for music emotion: the valence/arousal-based emotion model (Russell, 1980), a discrete emotion approach (Izard, 1972), and the Geneva Emotional Music Scale (GEMS) (Zentner et al., 2008). Stimuli were commercial recordings of the first 8 bars of 32 variations of the Theme of La Folia by A. Scarlatti, C. P. E. Bach, S. Rachmaninov and F. Liszt, with different combinations of 9 factors that were judged and averaged by 2 musical experts using a 5-point rating scale. Preliminary results are: (i) there exist significant correlations between structural parameters and descriptors for emotions in all of the models; (ii) correlations between structure and emotion are more remarkable for the valence/arousal-based emotion model and for the GEMS model, and are higher for register, note density, dynamics, accentuation and articulation; (iii) agreement among raters for the DES model is significantly lower than for the other two models. On the base of these results, we planned two new experiments focussing only on the valence/arousal-based emotion model and on the first-order GEMS model. They are: a second listening test based on a real music design (20 out of the previously selected 32 stimuli, corresponding to pieces featuring more extreme variability in the musical structure, with different combinations of 21 factors), and a new listening test based on a controlled and balanced design (24 variations with selected combinations of 4 factors, arranged and recorded in a deadpan performance by the first author). 24 participants (12 musicians and 12 non-musicians) have been involved in the current study, following the same procedure outlined above. We expect to extend understanding on the relationship between structure and emotion following more accurate, computational analyses of musical features, as well as by defining new predictors for emotion that are more appropriate for specific musical style(s) – like factorial analysis or multidimensional scaling.},

We use these frequencies in two different al-gorithms that alter the melodic content of classical music compositions to fit the ragtime rhythmic patterns, and then combine the modified melodies with traditional ragtime bass parts, producing new composi-tions which melodically and harmonically resemble the original music. We evaluate these algorithms by examining the quality of the ragtime music produced for eight excerpts of classical music alongside the output of a third algorithm run on the same excerpts; results are derived from a survey of 163 people who rated the quality of the ragtime output of the three algorithms.},

We here emphasize the role of vowels in the language-music relationship, arguing for a shared heritage of music and speech. Vowels play a decisive role in generating the sound or sonority of syllables, the main vehicles for transporting prosodic information in speech and singing. Timbre is, beyond question, the primary parameter that allows us to discriminate between different vowels, but vowels also have intrinsic pitch, intensity, and duration. There are striking correspondences between the number of vowels and the number of pitches in musical scales across cultures: a maximum of roughly 12 elements, a minimum of 2, a frequency peak at 5 to 7 elements, and the pentatonic scale and the 5-vowel systems as the most common. Moreover, we reveal coincidences between vowels and scales even in specific geographical regions and cultures. For example, languages with up to 4 vowels (e.g. Navaho, Cheyenne) tend to have tritonic or tetratonic scales, and languages with more than 5 vowels (e.g., Hopi) hexatonic or heptatonic scales. We will discuss the co-variation between vowel inventories and musical scales in the context of other ethnomusicological findings and with respect to singing and half-musical communication, both in ontogeny and phylogeny.},

We discuss the stages of hominid anatomy that permit music to be perceived and created, with the likelihood of both H. neanderthalensis and H. sapiens both being capable. The earlier hominid ability to emit sounds of variable pitch with some meaning, shows that music at its simplest level must have predated speech. The possibilities of anthropoid motor impulse suggest that rhythm may have preceded melody, though full control of rhythm may well not have come any earlier than the perception of music above. There are four evident purposes for music: dance, ritual, entertainment personal and communal, and above all social cohesion, again on both personal and communal levels. We then proceed to how instruments began, with a brief survey of the surviving examples from the Mousterian period onwards, including the possible Neanderthal evidence and the extent to which they showed ‘artistic’ potential in other fields. We warn that our performance on replicas of surviving instruments may bear little or no resemblance to that of the original players. We continue with how later instruments, strings and skin-drums began and developed into instruments we know in worldwide cultures today. The sound of music is then discussed, scales and intervals, and the lack of any consistency of consonant tonality around the world. This is followed by iconographic evidence of the instruments of later antiquity into the European Middle Ages, and finally the history of public performance, again from the possibilities of early humanity into more modern times. This paper draws the ethnomusicological perspective on the entire development of music, instruments, and performance, from the times of H. neanderthalensis and H. sapiens into those of modern musical history, and it is written with the deliberate intention of informing readers who are without special education in music, and providing necessary information for inquiries into the origin of music by cognitive scientists.},

Although the brain underpinnings of social cognition have been extensively studied, no empirical work has yet examined the impact of musical structure manipulation on the neural processing of emotional valence during mental state inferences. We used a novel sound-based theory-of-mind paradigm in which participants categorized stimuli of different sensory dissonance level in terms of positive/negative valence. Whilst consistent with previous studies which propose facilitated encoding of consonances, our results demonstrated that distinct levels of consonance/dissonance elicited differential influences on the right angular gyrus, an area implicated in mental state attribution and attention reorienting processes. Functional and effective connectivity analyses further showed that consonances modulated a specific inhibitory interaction from associative memory to mental state attribution substrates. Following evidence suggesting that individuals with autism may process social affective cues differently, we assessed the relationship between participants’ task performance and self-reported autistic traits in clinically typical adults. Higher scores on the social cognition scales of the AQ were associated with deficits in recognising positive valence in consonant sound cues. These findings are discussed with respect to Bayesian perspectives on autistic perception, which highlight a functional failure to optimize precision in relation to prior beliefs.},

	abstract = {The implication-realization model's description of tone-to-tone expectancies for continuations of melodies was examined. The model's predictions for expectancies are described with a small number of principles specified precisely in terms of interval size and direction of pitch. These principles were quantified and used to predict the data from three experiments in which listeners were required to judge how well individual test tones continued melodic fragments. The model successfully predicted listeners' judgments across different musical styles (British and Chinese folk songs and Webern Lieder), regardless of the extent of listeners' musical training (Experiments 1 and 2) or whether they were born and raised in China or the U.S.A. (Experiment 3). For each experiment, however, the collinearity of the model's predictors indicated that a simplified version of the model might predict the data equally well. Indeed, a revised and simplified model did not result in a loss of predictive power for any of the three experiments. Convergent evidence was provided in a reanalysis of data reported by Carlsen (1981) and Unyk and Carlsen (1987), whose listeners were required to sing continuations to two-tone stimuli. Thus, these findings indicate that the implication-realization model is over-specified. The consistency that was found across experimental tasks, musical styles, and listeners raises the possibility, however, that the revised version of the model may withstand the original model's claims of universality.},

	abstract = {During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation and information technology. With it has come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It should be a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting-the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book. Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors of statistics at Stanford University. They are prominent researchers in this area: Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive models and wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie wrote much of the statistical modeling software in S-PLUS and invented principal curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the Lasso and is co-author of the very successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Friedman is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including CART, MARS, and projection pursuit. FROM THE REVIEWS: TECHNOMETRICS "This is a vast and complex book. Generally, it concentrates on explaining why and how the methods work, rather than how to use them. Examples and especially the visualizations are principle features...As a source for the methods of statistical learning...it will probably be a long time before there is a competitor to this book."},

However, we still lack a significant body of empirical studies examining the ways in which specific structural characteristics of music may alter the affective processing of visual information. The present study suggests a way to use algorithmically generated music to assess the effect of sensory dissonance on the emotional judgment of a visual scene. This was examined by presenting participants with the same abstract animated film paired with consonant, dissonant and no music. The level of sensory dissonance was controlled in this experiment by employing different interval sets for the two contrasting background music conditions. Immediately after viewing the clip, participants were asked to complete a series of bipolar adjective ratings representing the three connotative dimensions (valence, activity and potency). Results revealed that relative to the control group of no music, consonant background music significantly biased the affective impact by guiding participants toward positive valence ratings. This finding is discussed in terms of interval content theory within the general per-spective of post-tonal music theory and David Temperley's probabilistic framework (model of tonalness).},

	abstract = {From a cognitive standpoint, the analysis of music in audiovisual contexts presents a helpful field in which to explore the links between musical structure and emotional response. This work emerges from an empirical study that shows strong evidence in support of the effect of tonal dissonance level on interpretations regarding the emotional content of visual information. From this starting point it progresses toward the design of interactive multi-media tools aimed at investigating the various ways in which music may shape the semantic processing of visual contexts. A pilot experiment (work in pro-gress) using these tools to study the emotional effects of sensory dissonance is briefly described. 1 Introduction and Background Although research in music cognition has been growing steadily during the past four decades, we still lack a significant body of empirical studies concerning the higher levels of musical response, including the emotional and aesthetic aspects. From a cognitive standpoint, the analysis of music in audiovisual contexts presents a helpful field in which to explore the affective and connotative aspects of musical information [1, 2, 3]. This paper describes work in progress to investigate the influence of tonal disso-nance on the emotional interpretation of visual information. The objectives of this paper are: • To report on a formal experiment showing the effect of tonal dissonance on inter-pretations regarding the emotional content of an animated short film (Section 2). • To describe a series of interactive multimedia tools designed to investigate the various ways in which music may shape the semantic processing of visual contexts (Section 3).},

Thus, children require more structure to render complex inputs learnable. In line with the Less-Is-More hypothesis, we interpret this as evidence that children's processing limitations affecting working memory capacity and executive control constrain the ability to represent and generate complexity, which, in turn, facilitates emergence of structure.

	abstract = {Mathematics and musicology have a long-standing relationship, but it is less productive than it might be. Reasons for this are explored in case studies of the ‘gap-fill’ melodic principle and of motivic analysis. In the first case empirical results do not unequivocally support the principle, but it continues to be used by musicologists. In the second, mathematical and computational approaches are found to differ significantly from those of music analysis in their purpose and effect. Other differences between the disciplines are examined in the use of metaphor in musical discourse, and misunderstandings over the role of abstraction and estimation. Throughout, human factors are found to confound proper communication. I propose that better interdisciplinary research could arise from honesty about limitations, effort in understanding each other’s disciplines, and humility about achievements. The response to Guerino Mazzola defends the use of imprecise concepts in some circumstances, particularly in the light of the impossibility of a precise definition of the domain of music. A possible contribution of mathematics to music through the demonstration of relationships between formulations of different theories is envisaged, specifically those of species counterpoint and functional harmony. In response to the contribution to this volume by Geraint Wiggins, I ask what music theory is for, and argue that, through education and the activity of composers, it has an influence on the very music it aims to describe. I defend Schoenberg from the charge of ignoring musical perception, and claim his music is successful even if not in the way he had envisaged. The music theoretic enterprise, including its mathematical branch, has an effect on musical culture, but that effect might be difficult to predict. Apparently contrasting ontologies of music as a psychological-cognitive entity or as having independent existence are shown not to be mutually exclusive. They are related to orthogonal dimensions of empirical and rational approaches in research. The best research employs both approaches.

While, for example, grammatical dependency relationships in sentences are mainly conveyed by the ordering of the words for languages like Mandarin Chinese, or Vietnamese, the word ordering is much less restricted for languages such as Inupiatun or Quechua, as those languages (also) use the internal structure of words (e.g. inflectional morphology) to mark grammatical relationships in a sentence. Based on a quantitative analysis of more than 1,500 unique translations of different books of the Bible in more than 1,100 different languages that are spoken as a native language by approximately 6 billion people (more than 80\% of the world population), we present large-scale evidence for a statistical trade-off between the amount of information conveyed by the ordering of words and the amount of information conveyed by internal word structure: languages that rely more strongly on word order information tend to rely less on word structure information and vice versa. In addition, we find that - despite differences in the way information is expressed - there is also evidence for a trade-off between different books of the biblical canon that recurs with little variation across languages: the more informative the word order of the book, the less informative its word structure and vice versa. We argue that this might suggest that, on the one hand, languages encode information in very different (but efficient) ways. On the other hand, content-related and stylistic features are statistically encoded in very similar ways.},

In an explicitly defined sense, one method forms clusters that are optimally connected, while the other forms clusters that are optimally compact.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

	abstract = {Mathematics and musicology have a long-standing relationship, but it is less productive than it might be. Reasons for this are explored in case studies of the ‘gap-fill’ melodic principle and of motivic analysis. In the first case empirical results do not unequivocally support the principle, but it continues to be used by musicologists. In the second, mathematical and computational approaches are found to differ significantly from those of music analysis in their purpose and effect. Other differences between the disciplines are examined in the use of metaphor in musical discourse, and misunderstandings over the role of abstraction and estimation. Throughout, human factors are found to confound proper communication. I propose that better interdisciplinary research could arise from honesty about limitations, effort in understanding each other’s disciplines, and humility about achievements. The response to Guerino Mazzola defends the use of imprecise concepts in some circumstances, particularly in the light of the impossibility of a precise definition of the domain of music. A possible contribution of mathematics to music through the demonstration of relationships between formulations of different theories is envisaged, specifically those of species counterpoint and functional harmony. In response to the contribution to this volume by Geraint Wiggins, I ask what music theory is for, and argue that, through education and the activity of composers, it has an influence on the very music it aims to describe. I defend Schoenberg from the charge of ignoring musical perception, and claim his music is successful even if not in the way he had envisaged. The music theoretic enterprise, including its mathematical branch, has an effect on musical culture, but that effect might be difficult to predict. Apparently contrasting ontologies of music as a psychological-cognitive entity or as having independent existence are shown not to be mutually exclusive. They are related to orthogonal dimensions of empirical and rational approaches in research. The best research employs both approaches. Mathematical and computational researchers are urged to explore research which moves away from the abstract, rational approach and makes greater use of empirical data. Suggestions are given for future research.},

Recent findings from a study investigating the enjoyment of sad films suggest that the positive relationship between felt sadness and enjoyment might be explained by feelings of being moved (Hanich et al., 2014). The aim of the present study was to investigate whether feelings of being moved also mediated the enjoyment of sad music. In Experiment 1, 308 participants listened to 5 sad music excerpts and rated their liking and felt emotions. A multilevel mediation analysis revealed that the initial positive relationship between liking and felt sadness (r = .22) was fully mediated by feelings of being moved. Experiment 2 explored the interconnections of perceived sadness, beauty, and movingness in 27 short music excerpts that represented independently varying levels of sadness and beauty. Two multilevel mediation analyses were carried out to test competing hypotheses: A) that movingness mediates the effect of perceived sadness on liking, or B) that perceived beauty mediates the effect of sadness on liking. Stronger support was obtained for Hypothesis A. Our findings suggest that – similarly to the enjoyment of sad films – the aesthetic appreciation of sad music is mediated by being moved. We argue that felt sadness may contribute to the enjoyment of sad music by intensifying feelings of being moved.},

	abstract = {'S Structural Hearing has already provided eloquent evidence that valuable insights into the music of Bart6k, Hindemith, and Stravinsky can be gained by a broader application of the concepts of Heinrich Schenker. But there have been few attempts to explain the music of Schoenberg, Berg, and Webern in these terms; the music of atonality and serialism does not readily yield to analysis from the standpoint of directed motion. Such an approach implies not only the possibility of recognizing clearly established origins and goals of motion, but the concomitant possibility of understanding the details of such motions as elaborations on various levels (foreground, middle-ground, or background) of a primordial progression or structure which can be assumed to underlie the entire composition and to unfold through time some sort of tonic sonority, triadic or otherwise.' The difficulty of attacking atonal and serial music with this set of assumptions seems obvious. Nevertheless, in reconsidering two brief piano pieces by Schoenberg and Webern, respectively, I have been tempted to set down in the discussion that follows a number of obser-vations made from this point of view. As it happens, both of the compositions in question have been analyzed from quite different vantage points in separate articles that appeared in the second issue of},

It can take place, however, only under certain musical conditions, including the systematic distinction between consonance and dissonance, a consistent set of relationships between tones of greater and lesser structural weight, and a clear differentiation of harmony from voice-leading. Posttonal music generally fails to meet these conditions and thus thwarts analysis in prolongational terms. To understand the middleground structure of posttonal music, we must employ instead an analytical model based on association, linking together distant tones by virtue of their shared register, timbre, metrical placement, or articulation.

Analyses of theorists such as Felix Salzer, Allen Forte, Joseph Straus, Edward Laufer, and Olli Väisälä are examined in order to reveal their various underlying theoretical principles. The thesis concludes with an analysis of Alban Berg’s Warm die Lüfte from his op. 2 collection that focuses on the prolongation of a referential sonority that forms the background of the song.

(2) Can features of jazz harmony (ninths, elevenths, and thirteenths) not appearing in the music Schenker analyzed be accounted for by Schenkerian analysis? and (3) Do improvising musicians really intend to create the complex structures shown in Schenkerian analyses? I argue that these questions imply mistaken assumptions about the content and origin of Schenker's theories, the role of analysis, the function of dissonance in common-practice harmony and in jazz, the nature of improvisation as opposed to composition, and the role of simplicity and complexity in popular and classical music. While my answers qualify the applicability of Schenker's theories to jazz, they also emphasize the importance of models in creating, explaining, and experiencing jazz.},

	abstract = {A P value measures a sample's compatibility with a hypothesis, not the truth of the hypothesis. Although P values are convenient and popular summaries of exper-imental results, we can be led astray if we consider them as our only metric 1 . Even in the ideal case of a rigorously designed randomized study fit to a predetermined model, P values still need to be supple-mented with other information to avoid misinterpretation. A P value is a probability statement about the observed sample in the context of a hypothesis, not about the hypotheses being tested. For example, suppose we wish to know whether disease affects the level of a biomarker. The P value of a comparison of the mean biomarker levels in healthy versus diseased samples would be the probability that a difference in means at least as large as the one observed can be generated from random samples if the disease does not affect the mean biomarker level. It is not the probability of the biomarker-level means in the two samples being equal—they either are or are not equal. However, this relationship between P values and inference about hypotheses is a critical point—interpretation of statistical analysis depends on it. It is one of the key themes in the American Statistical Association's statement on statistical significance and P values 2 , published to mitigate widespread misuse and misinterpretation of P values. This relationship is discussed in some of the 18 short com-mentaries that accompany the statement, from which three main ideas for using, interpreting and reporting P values emerge: the use of more stringent P value cutoffs supported by Bayesian analysis, use of the observed P value to estimate false discovery rate (FDR), and the combination of P values and effect sizes to create more informative confidence intervals. The first two of these ideas are currently most useful as guidelines for assessing how strongly the data support null versus alternative hypotheses, whereas the third could be used to assess how strongly the data support parameter values in the confidence interval. However, like P values, these methods will be biased toward the alternative hypothesis when used with a P value selected from the most significant of multiple tests or models 1 . To illustrate these three ideas, let's expand on the biomarker exam-ple above with the null hypothesis that disease does not influence the biomarker level. For samples, we'll use n = 10 individuals, ran-domly chosen from each of the unaffected and affected populations, assumed to be normally distributed with σ 2 = 1. At this sample size, a two-sample t-test has 80\% power to reject the null at significance a = 0.05 when the effect size is 1.32 (Fig. 1a). Suppose that we observe a difference in sample means of 1.2 and that our samples have a pooled s.d. of s p = 1.1. These give us t = 1.2/(s p √(2/n)) = 2.44 with d.f. = 2(n – 1) = 18 and a P value of 0.025. Once a P value has been computed, it is useful to assess the strength of evidence of the truth or falsehood of the null hypoth-esis. Here we can look to Bayesian analysis for ways to make this connection 3 , where decisions about statistical significance can be based on the Bayes factor, B, which is the ratio of average likeli-hoods under the alternative and null hypotheses. However, using Bayesian analysis adds an element of subjectivity because it requires the specification of a prior distribution for the model parameters under both hypotheses. Benjamin and Berger, in their discussion in ref. 2, note that the P value can be used to compute an upper bound for the Bayes factor, . The bound does not require the specification of a prior and holds for many reasonable choices of priors. For example, = 10 means that the alternative hypothesis is at most ten times more likely to be true than the null. Because it quantifies the extent to which the alternative hypothesis is more likely, the Bayes factor can be used for significance testing. Decision boundaries for the Bayes factor are less prescriptive than those for P values, with descriptors such as " anectodal, " " substantial, " " strong " and " decisive " often used for cutoff values. The exact terms and corresponding values vary across the literature, and their inter-pretation requires active consideration on the part of the researcher 4 . A Bayes factor of 20 or more is generally considered to be strong evi-dence for the alternative hypothesis. The Benjamin and Berger bound is given by ≤ –1/(e P ln(P)) for a given P value 5 (Fig. 1b). For example, when we reject the null at P {\textless} a = 0.05, we do so when the alternative hypothesis is at most ≤ 2.5 times more likely than the null! This significance boundary is considered by many Bayesians to be extremely weak to nonexistent evidence against the null hypothesis. For our biomarker example, we found P = 0.025 and thus conclude that the alternative hypothesis that disease affects the biomarker level is at most ≤ 3.9 times more likely than the null. If we insist on {\textgreater} 20, which corresponds to 'strong' evidence for the alternative, we need P {\textless} 0.0032 (Fig. 1b). Johnson, in a discussion in ref. 2, suggests testing at P {\textless} a = 0.005 ({\textgreater} 14) for statistical significance (Fig. 1b). Notice that the computation for does not use the power of the test. If we compute power using the same effect size of 1.32 but reject the null at a {\textless} 0.005 ({\textgreater} 14), the power is only 43\% (Fig. 1c). To achieve 80\% power at this cutoff, we would need a sample size of n = 18. Altman (this author), in a discussion in ref. 2, proposes to supple-ment P values with an estimate of the FDR by using plug-in values to account for both the power of the test and the prior evidence in Figure 1 {\textbar} Using a Bayesian heuristic to interpret the P value. (a) Power drops at more stringent P value cutoffs a. The curve is based on a two-sample t-test with n = 10 and an effect size of 1.32. (b) The Benjamin and Berger bound calibrates the P value to probability statements about the hypothesis. At P = 0.05, the bound suggests that our alternative hypothesis is at most 2.5 times more likely than the null (black dashed line). Also shown are the conventional Bayesian B – = 20 (blue dashed line; P = 0.0032) cutoff},

For example, if I flip a coin, the outcome of that toss is something you might want to know.1 Information theory is fundamentally about signals, not the meaning they carry. What we mea- sure thus requires interpretation. Conversely, in its universality, information theory applies just as much to the written and spoken words of humans as to the electronic machines for which it was first developed. And it allows us to compare quite very distant worlds—no more, and no less, exciting than, say, comparing the real income of a English bricklayer in 1350 to one in 1780, the hours worked by a French housewife in 1810 and 1950, or the life expectancy of a hunter-gatherer of the Maasai to that of a child in a Manchester factory of 1840.},

Virtually all such theories are predicated on tunable instruments (e.g. strings), whereas the voice is the most ancestral and universal instrument used to make music. In the present study, we analysed the tuning of sung musical intervals from a familiar song, doing so across both trained and untrained singers. Contrary to the predictions of traditional theories, we found that sung intervals (unlike those of instruments) showed marked overlap with neighbouring interval categories. Furthermore, we found that listeners of these sung productions did not base their aesthetic judgments of singing quality on the precision of tuning of sung intervals. We consolidate these results into a model of tonality based on both vocal and sensory factors that contribute to the formation of sung melodies.},

These approaches are coupled with a deep-seated, often tacit, belief in the reductionist program for understanding the link between the brain and behavior. The aim of this program is causal explanation through neural manipulations that allow testing of necessity and sufficiency claims. We argue, however, that another equally important approach seeks an alternative form of understanding through careful theoretical and experimental decomposition of behavior. Specifically, the detailed analysis of tasks and of the behavior they elicit is best suited for discovering compo-nent processes and their underlying algorithms. In most cases, we argue that study of the neural implemen-tation of behavior is best investigated after such behavioral work. Thus, we advocate a more pluralistic notion of neuroscience when it comes to the brain-behavior relationship: behavioral work provides understanding, whereas neural interventions test causality.},

	abstract = {A recently emerging view in music cognition holds that music is not only social and participatory in its production, but also in its perception, i.e. that music is in fact perceived as the sonic trace of social relations between a group of real or virtual agents. While this view appears compatible with a number of intriguing music cognitive phenomena, such as the links between beat entrainment and prosocial behaviour or between strong musical emotions and empathy, direct evidence is lacking that listeners are at all able to use the acoustic features of a musical interaction to infer the affiliatory or controlling nature of an underlying social intention. We created a novel experimental situation in which we asked expert music improvisers to communicate 5 types of non-musical social intentions, such as being domineering, disdainful or conciliatory, to one another solely using musical interaction. Using a combination of decoding studies, computational and psychoacoustical analyses, we show that both musically-trained and non musically-trained listeners can recognize relational intentions encoded in music, and that this social cognitive ability relies, to a sizeable extent, on the information processing of acoustic cues of temporal and harmonic coordination that are not present in any one of the musicians’ channels, but emerge from the dynamics of their interaction. By manipulating these cues in two-channel audio recordings and testing their impact on the social judgements of non-musician observers, we finally establish a causal relationship between the affiliation dimension of social behaviour and musical harmonic coordination on the one hand, and between the control dimension and musical temporal coordination on the other hand. These results provide novel mechanistic insights not only into the social cognition of musical interactions, but also into that of non-verbal interactions as a whole.},

The results of these two groups were compared to previously collected data (N = 60), where participants listened to either the same, sad-sounding piece of music without a description, or to neutral-sounding music. The induced emotions were measured as objectively as possible using indirect memory and judgment tasks. The results suggest that contextual information about a musical piece may indeed influence the emotional effects of that piece, as the sad narrative description appeared to intensify the sadness induced by the sad-sounding piece. The narrative descriptions may have enhanced emotion induction via the visual imagery mechanism (suggested by Juslin \& Västfjäll, 2008), as 80\% of participants in both groups reported thinking about imagery related to the narrative descriptions provided.

	abstract = {Simultaneous and sequential combinations of pitches are highly meaningful in music. Simultaneous intervals are the basis of harmony; sequential intervals are the basis of melody. Sensory factors constrain preferences for musical intervals, but learning also plays a crucial role. Music illustrates the potential for harmonic and melodic intervals to interact. The capacity to extract changes in pitch direction may be a general property of the auditory system that underlies the perception of both music and speech intonation; whether interval perception is a music-specific skill remains unclear. Our perceptions of the size of pitch intervals are susceptible to a range of extraneous influences such as timbre, pitch register, direction of pitch change, tonal context, and visual signals arising from performers. Knowledge of scales permits precise distinctions between interval sizes. Because scale development depends on instrument timbres, there is no one ideal scale or tuning system. However, most scales throughout history and across cultures are predictable from the harmonic series, reflecting the prevalence of harmonic spectra in musical instruments, including the human voice.

	abstract = {This study examines a group of synaesthetes who report colour sensations in response to music and other sounds. Experiment 1 shows that synaesthetes choose more precise colours and are more internally consistent in their choice of colours given a set of sounds of varying pitch, timbre and composition (single notes or dyads) relative to a group of controls. In spite of this difference, both controls and synaesthetes appear to use the same heuristics for matching between auditory and visual domains (e.g., pitch to lightness). We take this as evidence that synaesthesia may recruit some of the mechanisms used in normal cross-modal perception. Experiment 2 establishes that synaesthetic colours are automatically elicited insofar as they give rise to cross-modal Stroop interference. Experiment 3 uses a variant of the cross-modal Posner paradigm in which detection of a lateralised target is enhanced when combined with a non-informative but synaesthetically congruent sound-colour pairing. This suggests that synaesthesia uses the same (or an analogous) mechanism of exogenous cross-modal orienting as normal perception. Overall, the results support the conclusion that this form of synaesthesia recruits some of the same mechanisms used in normal cross-modal perception rather than using direct, privileged pathways between unimodal auditory and unimodal visual areas that are absent in most other adults.},

	abstract = {This review scrutinizes several findings on human hierarchical processing within the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in diverse cognitive domains. Converging evidence from previous studies has shown that the PFC, specifically, BA44, may function as the essential region for hierarchical processing across the domains. In language fMRI studies, BA 44 was significantly activated for the hierarchical processing of center-embedded sentences and this pattern of activations was also observed in artificial grammar. The same pattern was observed in the visuo-spatial domain where BA44 was actively involved in the processing of hierarchy for the visual symbol. Musical syntax, which is the rule-based arrangement of musical sets, has also been construed as hierarchical processing as in the language domain such that the activation in BA44 was observed in a chord sequence paradigm. P600 ERP was also engendered during the processing of musical hierarchy. Along with a longstanding idea that a human's number faculty is developed as a "by-product of language faculty", BA44 was closely involved in hierarchical processing in mental arithmetic. This review extended its discussion of hierarchical "processing" to hierarchical "behavior", that is, human action which has been referred to as being hierarchically composed. Several lesion and TMS studies supported the involvement of BA44 for hierarchical processing in the action domain. Lastly, the hierarchical organization of cognitive controls was discussed within the PFC, forming a cascade of top-down hierarchical processes operating along a posterior-to-anterior axis of the lateral PFC including BA44 within the network. It is proposed that PFC is actively involved in different forms of hierarchical processing and specifically BA44 may play an integral role in the process. Taking levels of proficiency and subcortical areas into consideration may provide further insight into the functional role of BA44 for hierarchical processing.},

The ability to use such representations may be advantageous in several domains: action sequencing, problem-solving, spatial navigation, social navigation and for the emergence of conventionalized com-munication systems. The ability to represent contiguous hierarchical levels with the same rules may lead subjects to expect unknown levels and constituents to behave similarly, and this prior knowledge may bias learning positively. Finally, a new paradigm to test for recursion is presented. Preliminary results suggest that the ability to represent recursion in the spatial domain recruits both visual and verbal resources.

Such maps are adaptive; they can change in response to a plethora of ongoing associations in the cortex. Hence, perceptions, rather than remaining fixed in memory, are acts of reconstruction, a perspective that encourages one to view music less as a collection of immutable structures and more as a subject for intentional creative perception.

	abstract = {In this paper, we explore a method for statistical genera-tion of music based on the style of Palestrina. First, we find patterns in one piece that are selected and organized according to a probabilistic distribution, using horizontal viewpoints to describe melodic properties of events. Once the template is chosen and covered with patterns, two-voice counterpoint in a florid style is generated using a first-order Markov model with constraints obtained from the template. For constructing the model, vertical slices of pitch and rhythm are compiled from a corpus of Pale-strina masses. The template enforces different restrictions that filter the possible paths through the generation pro-cess. A double backtracking algorithm is implemented to handle cases where no solutions are found at some point within a generation path.},

This paper is concerned with the gap between formal treatments of musical structure and the approach of cognitive psychology, concentrating on the problems that are a consequence of both the failure to establish a rapport between the two approaches, and the somewhat unstructured conceptual leakage that can also be observed between the two. By means of a single concrete musical example, some general characteristics of cognitive and analytical approaches are examined, and certain recommendations made, concluding with the proposal that we need a description of musical events and the way they are performed, perceived and created by performers, listeners and composers which gives greater recognition to the mutual relationship that characterises an organism and its environment.},

Emotional tunes were played alone and with, either positive, or negative, or neutral emotional scenes. Afterword, subjects (8 groups, each of 38 subjects, equally balanced by gender) were asked to decode the emotional feeling aroused by melodies ascribing them either emotional valences (positive, negative, I don’t know) or emotional labels (happy, sad, fear, anger, another emotion, I don’t know). It was found that dimensional emotional features rather than emotional labels strongly affect cognitive judgements of emotional melodies. Musical emotional information is most effectively retained when the task is to assign labels rather than valence values to melodies. In addition, significant misperception effects are observed when happy or positively judged melodies are concurrently played with negative scenes.},

	abstract = {The composition of polyphonic chorale music in the style of J.S Bach has represented a major challenge in automatic music composi-tion over the last decades. The art of Bach chorales composition involves combining four-part harmony with characteristic rhythmic patterns and typical melodic movements to produce musical phrases which begin, evolve and end (cadences) in a harmonious way. To our knowledge, no model so far was able to solve all these problems simultaneously using an agnostic machine-learning approach. This paper introduces DeepBach, a statistical model aimed at modeling polyphonic music and specifically four parts, hymn-like pieces. We claim that, after being trained on the chorale harmonizations by Johann Sebastian Bach, our model is capable of generating highly convincing chorales in the style of Bach. We evalu-ate how indistinguishable our generated chorales are from existing Bach chorales with a listening test. The results corroborate our claim. A key strength of DeepBach is that it is agnostic and flexible. Users can con-strain the generation by imposing some notes, rhythms or cadences in the generated score. This allows users to reharmonize user-defined melodies. DeepBach's generation is fast, making it usable for interactive music composition applications. Several generation examples are provided and discussed from a musical point of view.},

	abstract = {In modern Western music, melody is commonly conveyed by pitch changes in the highest-register voice, whereas meter or rhythm is often carried by instruments with lower pitches. An intriguing and recently suggested possibility is that the custom of assigning rhythmic functions to lower-pitch instruments may have emerged because of fundamental properties of the auditory system that result in superior time encoding for low pitches. Here we compare rhythm and synchrony perception between low- and high-frequency tones, using both behavioral and EEG techniques. Both methods were consistent in showing no superiority in time encoding for low over high frequencies. However, listeners were consistently more sensitive to timing differences between two nearly synchronous tones when the high-frequency tone followed the low-frequency tone than vice versa. The results demonstrate no superiority of low frequencies in timing judgments but reveal a robust asymmetry in the perception and neural coding of synchrony that reflects greater tolerance for delays of low- relative to high-frequency sounds than vice versa. We propose that this asymmetry exists to compensate for inherent and variable time delays in cochlear processing, as well as the acoustical properties of sound sources in the natural environment, thereby providing veridical perceptual experiences of simultaneity.},

How the auditory system extracts harmonic structures embedded in complex sounds and uses them to form a coherent unitary entity is not fully understood. Despite the prevalence of sounds rich in harmonic structures in our everyday hearing environment, it has remained largely unknown what neural mechanisms are used by the primate auditory cortex to extract these biologically important acoustic structures. In this study, we discovered a unique class of harmonic template neurons in the core region of auditory cortex of a highly vocal New World primate, the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), across the entire hearing frequency range. Marmosets have a rich vocal repertoire and a similar hearing range to that of humans. Responses of these neurons show nonlinear facilitation to harmonic complex sounds over inharmonic sounds, selectivity for particular harmonic structures beyond two-tone combinations, and sensitivity to harmonic number and spectral regularity. Our findings suggest that the harmonic template neurons in auditory cortex may play an important role in processing sounds with harmonic structures, such as animal vocalizations, human speech, and music.},

This melodic harmonisation system can be used, not only to mimic given harmonic styles, but, to generate novel harmonisations for diverse melodies by exploring the harmonic possibilities provided by the implied harmonies of input melodies, or by allowing the imposition of user-defined chord constraints leading thus to new unforeseen harmonic realisations. The various components of the proposed model are explained, and, then, a number of creative harmonisations of different melodies are presented, along with an intuitive statistical analysis, to illustrate the potential of the system.},

	abstract = {An empirical investigation of how local harmonic structures (e.g., chord progressions) contribute to the experience and enjoyment of uplifting trance (UT) music is presented. The connection between rhythmic and percussive elements and resulting trance-like states has been highlighted by musicologists, but no research, to our knowledge, has explored whether repeated harmonic elements influence affective responses in listeners of trance music. Two alternative hypotheses are discussed, the first highlighting the direct relationship between repetition/complexity and enjoyment, and the second based on the theoretical inverted-U relationship described by the Wundt curve. We investigate the connection between harmonic structure and subjective enjoyment through interdisciplinary behavioral and computational methods: First we discuss an experiment in which listeners provided enjoyment ratings for computer-generated UT anthems with varying levels of harmonic repetition and complexity. The anthems were generated using a statistical model trained on a corpus of 100 uplifting trance anthems created for this purpose, and harmonic structure was constrained by imposing particular repetition structures (semiotic patterns defining the order of chords in the sequence) on a professional UT music production template. Second, the relationship between harmonic structure and enjoyment is further explored using two computational approaches, one based on average Information Content, and another that measures average tonal tension between chords. The results of the listening experiment indicate that harmonic repetition does in fact contribute to the enjoyment of uplifting trance music. More compelling evidence was found for the second hypothesis discussed above, however some maximally repetitive structures were also preferred. Both computational models provide evidence for a Wundt-type relationship between complexity and enjoyment. By systematically manipulating the structure of chord progressions, we have discovered specific harmonic contexts in which repetitive or complex structure contribute to the enjoyment of uplifting trance music.},

A number of interpretations have been offered as to why musicians might follow this rule. A traditional account (Fux, 1725/1966) exhibits several inconsistencies. A modern interpretation based on auditory scene analysis appears to have merit. However, this interpretation has yet to be tested empirically. Three experiments test the scene-analysis account using numerosity judgments for complex chords as the dependent measure. In Experiment 1, musician listeners show decreasing accuracy in numerosity judgments when an octave is present in the sonority – as predicted. In experiments 2 and 3, chords were preceded by a single neighboring or distant tone. It was hypothesized that neighboring primes would increase the accuracy of nume...},

A number of new computational models accounting for some of the perceptual phenomena of ASA have been published recently. Here we provide a theoretically motivated review of these computational models, aiming to relate their guiding principles to the central issues of the theoretical framework of ASA. Specifically, we ask how they achieve the grouping and separation of sound elements and whether they implement some form of competition between alternative interpretations of the sound input. We consider the extent to which they include predictive processes, as important current theories suggest that perception is inherently predictive, and also how they have been evaluated. We conclude that current computational models of ASA are fragmentary in the sense that rather than providing general competing interpretations of ASA, they focus on assessing the utility of specific processes (or algorithms) for finding the causes of the complex acoustic signal. This leaves open the possibility for integrating complementary aspects of the models into a more comprehensive theory of ASA.},

This consonance characteristic turned out to show a simple V curve if consonance is plotted against the frequency percent deviation in a logarithmic scale, and it suggests a dynamic and a static factor in consonance perception. The most dissonant frequency deviation is approximately 10\% at f 1=440 Hz, and it increased with sound pressure and frequency, but it was not simply proportional to the critical bandwidth. For dyads whose two components have different sound‐pressure levels (SPLs)L 1 and L 2, the consonance differs with spectrum forms, even when the level difference is the same. A dyad with a spectrum form (P 1{\textgreater}P 2, f 1},

	abstract = {An empirical investigation of how local harmonic structures (e.g., chord progressions) contribute to the experience and enjoyment of uplifting trance (UT) music is presented. The connection between rhythmic and percussive elements and resulting trance-like states has been highlighted by musicologists, but no research, to our knowledge, has explored whether repeated harmonic elements influence affective responses in listeners of trance music. Two alternative hypotheses are discussed, the first highlighting the direct relationship between repetition/complexity and enjoyment, and the second based on the theoretical inverted-U relationship described by the Wundt curve. We investigate the connection between harmonic structure and subjective enjoyment through interdisciplinary behavioral and computational methods: First we discuss an experiment in which listeners provided enjoyment ratings for computer-generated UT anthems with varying levels of harmonic repetition and complexity. The anthems were generated using a statistical model trained on a corpus of 100 uplifting trance anthems created for this purpose, and harmonic structure was constrained by imposing particular repetition structures (semiotic patterns defining the order of chords in the sequence) on a professional UT music production template. Second, the relationship between harmonic structure and enjoyment is further explored using two computational approaches, one based on average Information Content, and another that measures average tonal tension between chords. The results of the listening experiment indicate that harmonic repetition does in fact contribute to the enjoyment of uplifting trance music. More compelling evidence was found for the second hypothesis discussed above, however some maximally repetitive structures were also preferred. Both computational models provide evidence for a Wundt-type relationship between complexity and enjoyment. By systematically manipulating the structure of chord progressions, we have discovered specific harmonic contexts in which repetitive or complex structure contribute to the enjoyment of uplifting trance music.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.cortex.2016.12.010},
	abstract = {Sentences encode hierarchical structural relations among words. Several neuroimaging experiments aiming to localize combinatory operations responsible for creating this structure during sentence comprehension have contrasted short, simple phrases and sentences to unstructured controls. Some of these experiments have revealed activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), associating these regions with basic syntactic combination. However, the wide variability of these effects across studies raises questions about this interpretation. In an fMRI experiment, we provide support for an alternative hypothesis: these regions underlie top-down syntactic predictions that facilitate sentence processing but are not necessary for building syntactic structure. We presented stimuli with three levels of structure: unstructured lists, two-word phrases, and simple, short sentences; and two levels of content: natural stimuli with real words and stimuli with open-class items replaced with pseudowords (jabberwocky). While both the phrase and sentence conditions engaged syntactic combination, our experiment only encouraged syntactic prediction in the sentence condition. We found increased activity for both natural and jabberwocky sentences in the left IFG (pars triangularis and pars orbitalis) and pSTS relative to unstructured word lists and two-word phrases, but we did not find any such effects for two-word phrases relative to unstructured word lists in these areas. Our results are most consistent with the hypothesis that increased activity in IFG and pSTS for basic contrasts of structure reflects syntactic prediction. The pars opercularis of the IFG showed a response profile consistent with verbal working memory. We found incremental effects of structure in the anterior temporal lobe (ATL), and increased activation only for sentences in the angular gyrus (AG)/temporal–parietal junction (AG/TPJ) – both regions showed these effects for stimuli with all real words. These findings support a role for the ATL in semantic combination and the AG/TPJ in thematic processing.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2016.12.024},
	abstract = {Music is a unique communication system for human beings. Iconic musical meaning is one dimension of musical meaning, which emerges from musical information resembling sounds of objects, qualities of objects, or qualities of abstract concepts. The present study investigated whether congenital amusia, a disorder of musical pitch perception, impacts processing of iconic musical meaning. With a cross-modal semantic priming paradigm, target images were primed by semantically congruent or incongruent musical excerpts, which were characterized by direction (upward or downward) of pitch change (Experiment 1), or were selected from natural music (Experiment 2). Twelve Mandarin-speaking amusics and 12 controls performed a recognition (implicit) and a semantic congruency judgment (explicit) task while their EEG waveforms were recorded. Unlike controls, amusics failed to elicit an N400 effect when musical meaning was represented by direction of pitch change, regardless of the nature of the tasks (implicit versus explicit). However, the N400 effect in response to musical meaning in natural musical excerpts was observed for both groups in both types of tasks. These results indicate that amusics are able to process iconic musical meaning through multiple acoustic cues in natural musical excerpts, but not through direction of pitch change. This is the first study to investigate the processing of musical meaning in congenital amusia, providing evidence in support of the “melodic contour deafness hypothesis” with regard to iconic musical meaning processing in this disorder.},

	abstract = {In music, a melodic motif is often played repeatedly in different pitch ranges and at different times. Event-related potential (ERP) studies have shown that the mismatch negativity (MMN) reflects memory trace processing that encodes two separate melodic lines (“voices”) with different motifs. Here we investigated whether a single motif presented in two voices is encoded as a single entity or two separate entities, and whether motifs overlapping in time impede or enhance encoding strength. Electroencephalogram (EEG) from 11 musically-trained participants was recorded while they passively listened to sequences of 5-note motifs where the 5th note either descended (standard) or ascended (deviant) relative to the previous note (20\% deviant rate). Motifs were presented either in one pitch range, or alternated between two pitch ranges, creating an “upper” and a “lower” voice. Further, motifs were either temporally isolated (silence in between), or temporally concurrent with two tones overlapping. When motifs were temporally isolated, MMN amplitude in the one-pitch-range condition was similar to that in the two-pitch-range upper voice. In contrast, no MMN, but P3a, was observed in the two-pitch-range lower voice. When motifs were temporally concurrent and presented in two pitch ranges, MMN exhibited a more posterior distribution in the upper voice, but again, was absent in the lower voice. These results suggest that motifs presented in two separate voices are not encoded entirely independently, but hierarchically, causing asymmetry between the upper and lower voice encoding even when no simultaneous pitches are presented.},

In support of this hypothesis, I review three research fields: (i) empirical studies on the adaptive value of EIP in non-human primates, mammals, songbirds, anurans, and insects; (ii) the beneficial effects of EIP in scaffolding language learning and social development in human infants; (iii) the cognitive relationship between linguistic prosody and the ability for music, which has often been identified as the evolutionary precursor of language.},

Next, we reduce IMA to a feature vector and model the detection of the meter and its first downbeat position prob-abilistically. In order to solve the meter detection prob-lem effectively, we explore various feature selection and parameter optimisation strategies, including Genetic, Max-imum Likelihood, and Expectation-Maximisation algo-rithms.

Inner Metric Analysis gen-erates metric hierarchies evoked by the note onsets of a piece. Syncopation in the rhythmic structure influences these hierarchies in different ways. The comparison of local and global perspectives on the metric structure allows to distinguish between different amounts of synco-pation present in a musical piece. This paper shows that the study of syncopation using Inner Metric Analysis contributes to explaining tapping performances of listeners. Hence comparing the structural descriptions generated by the model to results of a listening experiment helps to link music theoretic and perceptual studies.},

Mentally parsing and representing such structures, however, poses challenges for speech comprehension. In speech, hierarchical linguistic structures do not have boundaries that are clearly defined by acoustic cues and must therefore be internally and incrementally constructed during comprehension. We found that, during listening to connected speech, cortical activity of different timescales concurrently tracked the time course of abstract linguistic structures at different hierarchical levels, such as words, phrases and sentences. Notably, the neural tracking of hierarchical linguistic structures was dissociated from the encoding of acoustic cues and from the predictability of incoming words. Our results indicate that a hierarchy of neural processing timescales underlies grammar-based internal construction of hierarchical linguistic structure.},

	abstract = {Swets et al. (2008) present evidence that the so-called ambiguity advantage (Traxler et al., 1998), which has been explained in terms of the Unrestricted Race Model, can equally well be explained by assuming underspecification in ambiguous conditions driven by task-demands. Specifically, if comprehension questions require that ambiguities be resolved, the parser tends to make an attachment: when questions are about superficial aspects of the target sentence, readers tend to pursue an underspecification strategy. It is reason-able to assume that individual differences in strategy will play a significant role in the application of such strategies, so that studying average behavior may not be informative. In order to study the predictions of the good-enough processing theory, we implemented two versions of underspecification: the partial specification model (PSM), which is an implementation of the Swets et al. proposal, and a more parsimonious version, the non-specification model (NSM). We evaluate the relative fit of these two kinds of underspecification to Swets et al.'s data; as a baseline, we also fit three models that assume no underspecification. We find that a model without unspecification pro-vides a somewhat better fit than both underspecification models, while the NSM model provides a better fit than the PSM. We interpret the results as lack of unambiguous evidence in favor of underspecification; however, given that there is considerable existing evidence for good-enough processing in the literature, it is reasonable to assume that some underspecification might occur. Under this assumption, the results can be interpreted as tentative ev-idence for NSM over PSM. More generally, our work provides a method for choosing between models of real-time processes in sentence comprehension that make qualitative predictions about the relationship between several de-pendent variables. We believe that sentence processing research will greatly benefit from a wider use of such methods.},

	abstract = {The ability to predict upcoming structured events based on long-term knowledge and contextual priors is a fundamental principle of human cognition. Tonal music triggers predictive processes based on structural properties of harmony, i.e., regularities defining the arrangement of chords into well-formed musical sequences. While the neural architecture of structure-based predictions during music perception is well described, little is known about the neural networks for analogous predictions in musical actions and how they relate to auditory perception. To fill this gap, expert pianists were presented with harmonically congruent or incongruent chord progressions, either as musical actions (photos of a hand playing chords) that they were required to watch and imitate without sound, or in an auditory format that they listened to without playing. By combining task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with functional connectivity at rest, we identified distinct sub-regions in right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG) interconnected with parietal and temporal areas for processing action and audio sequences, respectively. We argue that the differential contribution of parietal and temporal areas is tied to motoric and auditory long-term representations of harmonic regularities that dynamically interact with computations in rIFG. Parsing of the structural dependencies in rIFG is co-determined by both stimulus- or task-demands. In line with contemporary models of prefrontal cortex organization and dual stream models of visual-spatial and auditory processing, we show that the processing of musical harmony is a network capacity with dissociated dorsal and ventral motor and auditory circuits, which both provide the infrastructure for predictive mechanisms optimising action and perception performance.},

Whereas several studies explored implicit learning of features of Western music, very little work has been done with respect to non-Western music, and synthetic predominantly used. The present study investigated implicit learning of modal melodic features in traditional North Indian music in a realistic and ecologically valid way. It employed a cross-grammar design, using melodic materials from two ragas that use the same scale, Toṛī and Multānī. Participants were trained on the ālāp section of either rāga and tested on novel excerpts from joṛ sections of both ragas featuring 5 distinct melodic features and using binary familiarity and 6-point confidence judgments. Three of the five features were melodically distinctive of either rāga, whereas two were only distinctive based on other than mere pitch sequence features (for instance, emphasis). Findings indicated that Western participants in both groups incidentally learned to recognise some, but not all, of the five features above chance level, and that the melodically distinctive features were better recognised than the non-distinctive ones. Confidence ratings suggest that participants’ performance was consistently correlated with confidence, indicating that they became aware of whether they were right in their responses, i.e. they possessed explicit judgment knowledge. Altogether participants began to incidentally acquire familiarity with a musical style from beyond their cultural background during only a very short exposure.},

	abstract = {William Abler identified a common principle of pattern generation underlying the open-ended diversity of forms exhibited by chemistry, genetics and human language. He named this generative principle "the particulate principle of self-diversifying systems". In passing Abler mentioned music as an instance of the principle, but did not develop the idea. Most extant music does not use the sound content of the continua of frequency (pitch) and time directly in the creation of musical patterns. Rather, those patterns are formed on the basis of elements drawn from a discretisation of the pitch continuum into "pitch sets" and, in all rhythmic music, from a discretisation of the time continuum into metrically based durations with proportional values. Musical patterns formed of these elements are perceived not as simple collections of unconnected elements, but as perceptual objects with identities of their own, capable of being combined into more complex patterns. Music thus exhibits all essential characteristics of a particulate system, and can be added to language as a so far unrecognized particulate system of the human world. It may even relate tolanguage in the way chemistry relates to genetics, namely as a necessary but not sufficient antecedent.},

The diverse forms and functions of human music place obstacles in the way of an evolutionary reconstruction of its origins. In the absence of any obvious homologues of human music among our closest primate relatives, theorizing about its origins, in order to make progress, needs constraints from the nature of music, the capacities it engages, and the contexts in which it occurs. Here we propose and examine five fundamental constraints that bear on theories of how music and some of its features may have originated. First, cultural trans-mission, bringing the formal powers of cultural as contrasted with Darwinian evolution to bear on its contents. Second, generativity, i.e. the fact that music generates infinite pattern diversity by finite means. Third, vocal production learning, without which there can be no human singing. Fourth, entrainment with perfect synchrony, without which there is neither rhythmic ensemble music nor rhythmic dancing to music. And fifth, the universal propensity of humans to gather occasionally to sing and dance together in a group, which suggests a motivational basis endemic to our biology. We end by considering the evolutionary context within which these constraints had to be met in the genesis of human musicality.},

To address these challenges, we measured fMRI responses to 165 natural sounds and inferred canonical response profiles ("components") whose weighted combinations explained voxel responses throughout auditory cortex. This analysis revealed six components, each with interpretable response characteristics despite being unconstrained by prior functional hypotheses. Four components embodied selectivity for particular acoustic features (frequency, spectrotemporal modulation, pitch). Two others exhibited pronounced selectivity for music and speech, respectively, and were not explainable by standard acoustic features. Anatomically, music and speech selectivity concentrated in distinct regions of non-primary auditory cortex. However, music selectivity was weak in raw voxel responses, and its detection required a decomposition method. Voxel decomposition identifies primary dimensions of response variation across natural sounds, revealing distinct cortical pathways for music and speech.},

	abstract = {Syntactic operations in language and music are well established and known to be linked in cognitive and neuroanatomical terms. What remains a matter of debate is whether the notion of syntax also applies to human actions and how those may be linked to syntax in language and music. The present electroencephalography (EEG) study explored syntactic processes during the observation, motor programming, and execution of musical actions. Therefore, expert pianists watched and imitated silent videos of a hand playing 5-chord sequences in which the last chord was syntactically congruent or incongruent with the preceding harmonic context. 2-chord sequences that diluted the syntactic predictability of the last chord (by reducing the harmonic context) served as a control condition. We assumed that behavioural and event-related potential (ERP) effects (i.e., differences between congruent and incongruent trials) that were significantly stronger in the 5-chord compared to the 2-chord sequences are related to syntactic processing. According to this criterion, the present results show an influence of syntactic context on ERPs related to (i) action observation and (ii) the motor programming for action imitation, as well as (iii) participants' execution times and accuracy. In particular, the occurrence of electrophysiological indices of action inhibition and reprogramming when an incongruent chord had to be imitated implies that the pianist's motor system anticipated (and revoked) the congruent chord during action observation. Notably, this well-known anticipatory potential of the motor system seems to be strongly based upon the observer's music-syntactic knowledge, thus suggesting the " embodied" processing of musical syntax. The combined behavioural and electrophysiological data show that the notion of musical syntax not only applies to the auditory modality but transfers - in trained musicians - to a " grammar of musical action" . ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Second, we present results of our measures in 34 lan- guages and demonstrate a correlation be- tween quantitative word order freedom of subjects and objects and the presence of nominative-accusative case marking.

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0151570},
	abstract = {Music, like languages, is one of the key components of our culture, yet musical evolution is still poorly known. Numerous studies using computational methods derived from evolutionary biology have been successfully applied to varied subset of linguistic data. One of the major drawback regarding musical studies is the lack of suitable coded musical data that can be analysed using such evolutionary tools. Here we present for the first time an original set of musical data coded in a way that enables construction of trees classically used in evolutionary approaches. Using phylogenetic methods, we test two competing theories on musical evolution: vertical versus horizontal transmission. We show that, contrary to what is currently believed, vertical transmission plays a key role in shaping musical diversity. The signal of vertical transmission is particularly strong for intrinsic musical characters such as metrics, rhythm, and melody. Our findings reveal some of the evolutionary mechanisms at play for explaining musical diversity and open a new field of investigation in musical evolution.},

	abstract = {In noun phrase (NP) coordinate constructions (e.g., NP and NP), there is a strong tendency for the syntactic structure of the second conjunct to match that of the first; the second conjunct in such constructions is therefore low in syntactic information. The theory of uniform information density predicts that low-information syntactic constructions will be counterbalanced by high information in other aspects of that part of the sentence, and high-information constructions will be counterbalanced by other low-information components. Three predictions follow: (a) lexical probabilities (measured by N-gram probabilities and head-dependent probabilities) will be lower in second conjuncts than first conjuncts; (b) lexical probabilities will be lower in matching second conjuncts (those whose syntactic expansions match the first conjunct) than nonmatching ones; and (c) syntactic repetition should be especially common for low-frequency NP expansions. Corpus analysis provides support for all three of these predictions.},

Since then, the list of areas which have interacted with the development of graph grammars has grown quite impressively. Besides the aforementioned areas, it includes software specification and development, VLSI layout schemes, database design, modeling of concurrent systems, massively parallel computer architectures, logic programming, computer animation, developmental biology, music composition, visual languages, and many others.The area of graph grammars and graph transformations generalizes formal language theory based on strings and the theory of term rewriting based on trees. As a matter of fact, within the area of graph grammars, graph transformation is considered a fundamental computation paradigm where computation includes specification, programming, and implementation. Over the last three decades, graph grammars have developed at a steady pace into a theoretically attractive and important-for-applications research field.Volume 2 of the indispensable Handbook of Graph Grammars and Computing by Graph Transformations considers applications to functional languages, visual and object-oriented languages, software engineering, mechanical engineering, chemical process engineering, and images. It also presents implemented specification languages and tools, and structuring and modularization concepts for specification languages. The contributions have been written in a tutorial/survey style by the top experts in the corresponding areas. This volume is accompanied by a CD-Rom containing implementations of specification environments based on graphtransformation systems, and tools whose implementation is based on the use of graph transformation systems.},

Parameter search with EM produces higher quality analyses for human language data than those previously exhibited by unsupervised systems, giving the best published unsupervised parsing results on the ATIS corpus. Experiments on Penn treebank sentences of comparable length show an even higher constituent F1 of 71\% on non-trivial brackets. We compare distributionally induced and actual part-of-speech tags as input data, and examine extensions to the basic model. We discuss errors made by the system, compare the system to previous models, and discuss upper bounds, lower bounds, and stability for this task.},

	abstract = {The mammalian auditory system extracts features from the acoustic environment based on the responses of spatially distributed sets of neurons in the subcortical and cortical auditory structures. The characteristic responses of these neurons (linearly approximated by their spectro-temporal receptive fields, or STRFs) suggest that auditory representations are formed, as early as in the inferior colliculi, on the basis of a time, frequency, rate (temporal modulations) and scale (spectral modulations) analysis of sound. However, how these four dimensions are integrated and processed in subsequent neural networks remains unclear. In this work, we present a new methodology to generate computational insights into the functional organization of such processes. We first propose a systematic framework to explore more than a hundred different computational strategies proposed in the literature to process the output of a generic STRF model. We then evaluate these strategies on their ability to compute perceptual distances between pairs of environmental sounds. Finally, we conduct a meta-analysis of the dataset of all these algorithms' accuracies to examine whether certain combinations of dimensions and certain ways to treat such dimensions are, on the whole, more computationally effective than others. We present an application of this methodology to a dataset of ten environmental sound categories, in which the analysis reveals that (1) models are most effective when they organize STRF data into frequency groupings-which is consistent with the known tonotopic organization of receptive fields in auditory structures -, and that (2) models that treat STRF data as time series are no more effective than models that rely only on summary statistics along time-which corroborates recent experimental evidence on texture discrimination by summary statistics.},

One region that has been shown to be causally involved in the process for nonmusicians is the supramarginal gyrus (SMG). The present study aims at replicating this finding and at further examining the role of the SMG for pitch memory in musicians. Nonmusicians and musicians received cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the left SMG, right SMG, or sham stimulation, while completing a pitch recognition, pitch recall, and visual memory task. Cathodal tDCS over the left SMG led to a significant decrease in performance on both pitch memory tasks in nonmusicians. In musicians, cathodal stimulation over the left SMG had no effect, but stimulation over the right SMG impaired performance on the recognition task only. Furthermore, the results show a more pronounced deterioration effect for longer pitch sequences indicating that the SMG is involved in maintaining higher memory load. No stimulation effect was found in both groups on the visual control task. These findings provide evidence for a causal distinction of the left and right SMG function in musicians and nonmusicians.},

Subjects made a speeded true/false decision about a target chord following a prime chord to which it was either closely or distantly related harmonically. Using a major/minor decision task in Experiment 1, we found that major targets were identified faster, and with fewer errors, when they were related than when unrelated. An apparent absence (and possible reversal) of this effect for minor targets can be attributed to the prime's biasing effect on the target's stability. In Experiments 2 and 3 we tested this hypothesis by employing an in-tune/out-of-tune decision for major and minor targets separately. Both major and minor in-tune targets were identified faster when related than when unrelated. We outline a spreading activation model which consists of a network of harmonic relations. Priming results from the indirect activation of chord nodes linked through the network.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a music analysing system called the automatic time-span tree analyser (ATTA). ATTA derives a time-span tree that assigns a hierarchy of “structural importance” to the notes of a piece of music based on the generative theory of tonal music (GTTM). Although the time-span tree has been applied in music summarization and collaborative music creation systems, these systems use time-span trees manually analysed by experts in musicology. Current systems based on GTTM cannot acquire a time-span tree without manual application of most of the rules, since GTTM does not resolve much of the ambiguity involved in the application of the rules. To solve this problem, we propose a novel computational model of GTTM that re-formalizes the rules through a computer implementation. The main advantage of our approach is that we can introduce adjustable parameters, which enables us to assign priorities to the rules. Our analyser automatically acquires time-span trees by configuring the parameters that cover 17 out of 26 GTTM rules for constructing a time-span tree. Experimental results show that after these parameters were tuned, our method could outperform a baseline performance. We hope to distribute the time-span tree analyser as a tool for various musical tasks, such as searching and arranging music.},

	issn = {0262193035},
	abstract = {Investigations of classes of grammars that are nontransformational and at the same time highly constrained are of interest both linguistically and mathematically. Context-free grammars (CFG) obviously form such a class. CFGs are not adequate (both weakly and strongly) to characterize some aspects of language structure. Thus how much more power beyond CFG is necessary to describe these phenomena is an important question. Based on certain properties of tree adjoining grammars (TAG) an approximate characterization of class of grammars, mildly context-sensitive grammars (MCSG), has been proposed earlier. In this paper, we have described the relationship between several different grammar formalisms, all of which belong to MCSG. In particular, we have shown that head grammars (HG), combinatory categorial grammars (CCG), and linear indexed grammars (LIG) and TAG are all weakly equivalent. These formalisms are all distinct from each other at least in the following aspects: (a) the formal objects and operations in each formalism, (b) the domain of locality over which dependencies are specified, (c) the degree to which recursion and the domain of dependencies are factored, and (d) the linguistic insights that are captured in the formal objects and operations in each formalism. A deeper understanding of this convergence is obtained by comparing these formalisms at the level of the derivation structures in each formalism. We have described a formalism, the linear context-free rewriting system (LCFR), as a first attempt to capture the closeness of the derivation structures of these formalisms. LCFRs thus make the notion of MCSGs more precise. We have shown that LCFRs are equivalent to muticomponent tree adjoining grammars (MCTAGs), and also briefly discussed some variants of TAGs, lexicalized TAGs, feature structure based TAGs, and TAGs in which local domination and linear precedence are factored TAG(LD/LP).},

Newborns prefer their mother's voice over other voices [4-8] and perceive the emotional content of messages conveyed via intonation contours in maternal speech ("motherese") [9]. Their perceptual preference for the surrounding language [10-12] and their ability to distinguish between prosodically different languages [13-15] and pitch changes [16] are based on prosodic information, primarily melody. Adult-like processing of pitch intervals allows newborns to appreciate musical melodies and emotional and linguistic prosody [17]. Although prenatal exposure to native-language prosody influences newborns' perception, the surrounding language affects sound production apparently much later [18]. Here, we analyzed the crying patterns of 30 French and 30 German newborns with respect to their melody and intensity contours. The French group preferentially produced cries with a rising melody contour, whereas the German group preferentially produced falling contours. The data show an influence of the surrounding speech prosody on newborns' cry melody, possibly via vocal learning based on biological predispositions. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	doi = {10.1073/pnas.1612132113},
	abstract = {The neural processes that underlie your ability to read and under-stand this sentence are unknown. Sentence comprehension occurs very rapidly, and can only be understood at a mechanistic level by discovering the precise sequence of underlying computational and neural events. However, we have no continuous and online neural measure of sentence processing with high spatial and temporal resolution. Here we report just such a measure: intracranial record-ings from the surface of the human brain show that neural activity, indexed by γ-power, increases monotonically over the course of a sentence as people read it. This steady increase in activity is absent when people read and remember nonword-lists, despite the higher cognitive demand entailed, ruling out accounts in terms of generic attention, working memory, and cognitive load. Re-sponse increases are lower for sentence structure without meaning (" Jabberwocky " sentences) and word meaning without sentence structure (word-lists), showing that this effect is not explained by responses to syntax or word meaning alone. Instead, the full effect is found only for sentences, implicating compositional processes of sentence understanding, a striking and unique feature of human language not shared with animal communication systems. This work opens up new avenues for investigating the sequence of neu-ral events that underlie the construction of linguistic meaning. language {\textbar} ECoG {\textbar} compositionality {\textbar} syntax {\textbar} semantics H ow does a sequence of sounds emerging from one person's mouth create a complex meaning in another person's mind? Although we have long known where language is processed in the brain (1–3), we still know almost nothing about how neural circuits extract and represent the meaning of a sentence. A powerful method for addressing this question is intracranial re-cording of neural activity directly from the cortical surface in neurosurgery patients (i.e., electrocorticography or ECoG) (4, 5). Although opportunities for ECoG data collection are rare, de-termined by clinical—not scientific—priorities, they nonetheless offer an unparalleled combination of spatial and temporal reso-lution, and further provide direct measures of actual neural ac-tivity, rather than indirect measures via blood flow (as in PET, fMRI, and near infrared spectroscopy/optical imaging). ECoG data are particularly valuable for the study of uniquely human functions like language, where animal models are inadequate. Here we used ECoG to identify the neural events that occur online as the meaning of a sentence is extracted and represented. Prior intracranial recording studies of language have largely fo-cused on speech perception and production (e.g., refs. 6–11) and word-level processes (e.g., refs. 12–26). However, the most distinc-tive feature of human language is its compositionality: the ability to create and understand complex meanings from novel combinations of words structured into phrases and sentences (27). As a first step toward understanding the neural basis of sentence comprehension, we recorded intracranial responses while participants read sentences and three kinds of control stimuli. In each trial, a string of eight items (words or nonwords) were presented sequentially, enabling us to separately measure the neural response to each item individually; to encourage attention to all stimuli (whether meaningful or not), participants decided at the end of each trial whether a probe word/ nonword appeared in the preceding string. Our four stimulus conditions (materials adapted from ref. 28; ex-amples are shown in the " Sample materials " table below) enabled us to orthogonally vary the presence of word meaning and sentence structure. Word-lists (W) included the same words as the sentences (S)},

The Gold-MSI is based around the multidimensional construct of Musical Sophistication and builds on the idea that musical expertise cannot only be developed through musical training on an instrument but also through active engagement with music in its many facets. The questionnaire was developed with a very large English sample (Müllensiefen et al., 2014) and comprises musical expertise with five factors as well as the general factor Musical Sophistication. The English Gold-MSI questionnaire was translated into German and evaluated with a German sample (N = 641). Using confirmative factor analysis the underlying factor structure was confirmed. Furthermore, the results show high reliabilities of the five sub-factors as well as the general factor Musical Sophistication (Cronbach’s alpha between .72 and .91.). Additionally, relationships between variables of the socio-economic status and the sub-factors of the Gold-MSI of the German sample are investigated using a structural equation model. The statistical model reveals positive relationships between income and professional status on the one hand and musical training, perceptual abilities and emotional engagement with music on the other hand. The inventory is freely available and is designed to contribute to the refined investigation of musical sophistication and expertise in German speaking countries.

	abstract = {Recent studies establish that cortical oscillations track naturalistic speech in a remarkably faithful way. Here, we test whether such neural activity, particularly low-frequency ({\textless}8 Hz; delta-theta) oscillations, similarly entrain to music and whether experience modifies such a cortical phenomenon. Music of varying tempi was used to test entrainment at different rates. In three magnetoencephalography experiments, we recorded from nonmusicians, as well as musicians with varying years of experience. Recordings from nonmusicians demonstrate cortical entrainment that tracks musical stimuli over a typical range of tempi, but not at tempi below 1 note per second. Importantly, the observed entrainment correlates with performance on a concurrent pitch-related behavioral task. In contrast, the data from musicians show that entrainment is enhanced by years of musical training, at all presented tempi. This suggests a bidirectional relationship between behavior and cortical entrainment, a phenomenon that has not previously been reported. Additional analyses focus on responses in the beta range (∼15-30 Hz)-often linked to delta activity in the context of temporal predictions. Our findings provide evidence that the role of beta in temporal predictions scales to the complex hierarchical rhythms in natural music and enhances processing of musical content. This study builds on important findings on brainstem plasticity and represents a compelling demonstration that cortical neural entrainment is tightly coupled to both musical training and task performance, further supporting a role for cortical oscillatory activity in music perception and cognition.},

Significant progress has since been made in understanding the role of neural oscillations and the neural structures that support synchronized responses to musical rhythm. Synchronized neural activity has been observed in auditory and motor networks, and has been linked with attentional allocation and movement coordination. Here we describe a neurodynamic model that shows how self-organization of oscillations in interacting sensory and motor networks could be responsible for the formation of the pulse percept in complex rhythms. We test the model's prediction that pulse can be perceived at a frequency for which no spectral energy is present in the amplitude envelope of the acoustic rhythm. The result provides a theoretical link between oscillatory neurodynamics and the induction of pulse and meter in musical rhythm.},

The frequency of occurrence of various interval classes in a given pitch-class set can be correlated with corresponding measures of perceived consonance for each interval class. If a goal of music-making is to promote a euphonious effect, then those sets that exhibit a pleth- ora of consonant intervals and a paucity of dissonant intervals might be of particular interest to musicians. In this paper, it is shown that the pitch-class sets that provide the most consonant interval-class invento- ries are the major diatonic scale, the harmonic and melodic minor scales, and equally tempered equivalents of the Japanese Ritsu mode, the common penta tonic scale, and the common "blues" scale. Conso- nant harmonic intervals are more readily available in these sets than in other possible sets that can be drawn from the 12 equally tempered pitch chromas.},

	abstract = {Humans generate recursive hierarchies in a variety of domains, including linguistic, social and visuo-spatial modalities. The ability to represent recursive structures has been hypothesized to increase the efficiency of hierarchical processing. Theoretical work together with recent empirical findings suggests that the ability to represent the self-similar structure of hierarchical recursive stimuli may be supported by internal neural representations that compress raw external information and increase efficiency. In order to explicitly test whether the representation of recursive hierarchies depends on internalized rules we compared the processing of visual hierarchies represented either as recursive or non-recursive, using task-free resting-state fMRI data. We aimed to evaluate the relationship between task-evoked functional networks induced by cognitive representations with the corresponding resting-state architecture. We observed increased connectivity within Default Mode Network (DMN) related brain areas during the representation of recursion, while non-recursive representations yielded increased connectivity within the Fronto-Parietal Control-Network. Our results suggest that human hierarchical information processing using recursion is supported by the DMN. In particular, the representation of recursion seems to constitute an internally-biased mode of information-processing that is mediated by both the core and dorsal-medial subsystems of the DMN. Compressed internal rule representations mediated by the DMN may help humans to represent and process hierarchical structures in complex environments by considerably reducing information processing load.},

Here, using electroencephalography (EEG), we explore the perception of hierarchical boundaries in music, and test whether musical expertise modifies such processing. Musicians and non-musicians were presented with musical excerpts containing boundaries at three hierarchical levels, including section, phrase and period boundaries. Non-boundary was chosen as a baseline condition. Recordings from musicians showed CPS (closure positive shift) was evoked at all the three boundaries, and their amplitude increased as the hierarchical level became higher, which suggest that musicians could represent music events at different timescales in a hierarchical way. For non-musicians, the CPS was only elicited at the period boundary and undistinguishable negativities were induced at all the three boundaries. The results indicate that a different and less clear way was used by non-musicians in boundary perception. Our findings reveal, for the first time, an ERP correlate of perceiving hierarchical boundaries in music, and show that the phrasing ability could be enhanced by musical expertise.},

	abstract = {The functions of dance and music in human evolution are a mystery. Current research on the evolution of music has mainly focused on its melodic attribute which would have evolved alongside proto-language. Instead, we propose an alternative conceptual framework which focuses on the co-evolution of rhythm and dance (R\&D) as intertwined aspects of a multimodal phenomenon characterized by the unity of action and perception. Reviewing the current literature from this viewpoint we propose the hypothesis that R\&D have co-evolved long before other musical attributes and (proto)-language. Our view is supported by increasing experimental evidence particularly in infants and children: beat is perceived and anticipated already by newborns and rhythm perception depends on body movement. Infants and toddlers spontaneously move to a rhythm irrespective of their cultural background. If this behavior is universal, R\&D must have an essential function in human evolution. Conceivable evolutionary functions of R\&D include sexual attraction, transmission of mating signals, synchronization of many individuals, social bonding, appeasement of hostile individuals, pre- and extra-verbal communication, improvement of body coordination, as well as pain killing, anti-depressive, and anti-boredom functions. The impulse to dance may have been prepared by the susceptibility of infants to be soothed by rocking. Dance enables embodied individual and collective memorizing; in many cultures R\&D are used for entering trance, a base for shamanism and early religions. Rhythm is necessary to codify human speech and dance encompasses gesture. In future studies attention should be paid to which attribute of music is focused and that the close mutual relation between R\&D is taken into account. The possible evolutionary functions of dance deserve more attention.},

Conceptually, whereas mispredicted stimuli may induce both prediction error generated by prediction that is not perceived and prediction error generated by sensory input that is not anticipated, unpredicted stimuli involves no top-down, only bottom-up, propagation of information in the system. Here, we examined the possibility that the processing of mispredicted and unpredicted stimuli are dissociable at the neurophysiological level using human electroencephalography. We presented participants with sets of five tones in which the frequency of the fifth tones was predicted, mispredicted, or unpredicted. Participants were required to press a key when they detected a softer fifth tone to maintain their attention. We found that mispredicted and unpredicted stimuli are associated with different amount of cortical activity, probably reflecting differences in prediction error. Moreover, relative to predicted stimuli, the mispredicted prediction error manifested as neuronal enhancement and the unpredicted prediction error manifested as neuronal attenuation on the N1 event-related potential component. These results highlight the importance of differentiating between the two nonpredicted stimuli in theoretical work on predictive coding.},

I begin with a problematic story, draw some general conclusions, introduce relevant concepts from Lerdahl and Jackendoff (1983) and related work, propose some cognitive constraints on compositional systems, discuss "pitch space", and explain why serial (or 12-tone) organizations are cognitively opaque. Most of these topics deserve fuller treatment than is given in these pages. My concern here is just to lay out a basic, if wide-ranging, argument. I am not interested in passing judgement on the composers and compositions that are mentioned, particularly not on the remarkable work by Boulez that I use as a representative example. The thrust of my argument is psychological rather than aesthetic. But since aesthetic issues inevitably impinge on the discussion, I treat them briefly at the end. Boulez's Le Marteau sans Maftre (1954) was widely hailed as a masterpiece of post-war serialism. Yet nobody could figure out, much less hear, how the piece was serial. From hints in Boulez (1963), Koblyakov (1977) at last determined that it 9 was indeed serial, though in an idiosyncratic way. In the interim listeners made what sense they could of the piece in ways unrelated to its construction. Nor has Koblyakov's decipherment subsequently changed how the piece is heard. Meanwhile most composers have discarded serialism, with the result that Koblyakov's contribution has caused barely a ripple of professional interest. The serial organization of Le Marteau would appear, 30 years later, to be irrelevant. This story is, or should be, disturbing. There is a huge gap here between compositional system and cognized result. H o w can this be? One might suppose that the impenetrability of Le Marteau's serial organization is due to insufficient exposure. After all, the piece was innovative; listeners must become accustomed to novel stimuli. Such has been the traditional defence of new art in the face of incomprehension. One might refine this view by pointing out that there is little repetition in Le Marteau. The lack of redundancy perhaps overwhelms the listener's processing capacities. Comprehensibility, then, is arguably a consequence both of the degree of conditioning to the materials and},

These effects strongly resemble two effects associated with the processing of linguistic incongruities: a P600, resembling a typical response to syntactic incongruities in language, and an N500, evocative of the N400, which is typically elicited in response to semantic incongruities in language. Despite the robustness of these two patterns in the musical incongruity literature, no consensus has yet been reached as to the reasons for the existence of two distinct responses to harmonic incongruities. This study was the first to use behavioural and ERP data to test two possible explanations for the existence of these two patterns: the musicianship of listeners, and the resolved or unresolved nature of the harmonic incongruities. Results showed that harmonically incongruous notes and chords elicited a late positivity similar to the P600 when they were embedded within sequences which started and ended in the same key (harmonically resolved). The notes and chords which indicated that there would be no return to the original key (leaving the piece harmonically unresolved) were associated with a further P600 in musicians, but with a negativity resembling the N500 in non-musicians. We suggest that the late positivity reflects the conscious perception of a specific element as being incongruous with its context and the efforts of musicians to integrate the harmonic incongruity into its local context as a result of their analytic listening style, while the late negativity reflects the detection of the absence of resolution in non-musicians as a result of their holistic listening style.},

	abstract = {The relationship between the neurobiology of speech and music has been investigated for more than a century. There remains no widespread agreement regarding how (or to what extent) music perception utilizes the neural circuitry that is engaged in speech processing, particularly at the cortical level. Prominent models such as Patel’s Shared Syntactic Integration Resource Hypothesis (SSIRH) and Koelsch’s neurocognitive model of music perception suggest a high degree of overlap, particularly in the frontal lobe, but also perhaps more distinct representations in the temporal lobe with hemispheric asymmetries. The present meta-analysis study used activation likelihood estimate analyses to identify the brain regions consistently activated for music as compared to speech across the functional neuroimaging (fMRI and PET) literature. Eighty music and 91 speech neuroimaging studies of healthy adult control subjects were analyzed. Peak activations reported in the music and speech studies were divided into four paradigm categories: passive listening, discrimination tasks, error/anomaly detection tasks and memory-related tasks. We then compared activation likelihood estimates within each category for music versus speech, and each music condition with passive listening. We found that listening to music and to speech preferentially activate distinct temporo-parietal bilateral cortical networks. We also found music and speech to have shared resources in the left pars opercularis but speech-specific resources in the left pars triangularis. The extent to which music recruited speech-activated frontal resources was modulated by task. While there are certainly limitations to meta-analysis techniques particularly regarding sensitivity, this work suggests that the extent of shared resources between speech and music may be task-dependent and highlights the need to consider how task effects may be affecting conclusions regarding the neurobiology of speech and music.},

Past theories posit a sharing of neural resources between syntax processing in music and language (Patel, 2003), and a dynamic attention network that governs general temporal processing (Large \& Jones, 1999). Both make predictions about music and language processing over time. Experiment 1 of this study investigates the relationship between rhythmic expectancy and musical and linguistic syntax in a reading time paradigm. Stimuli (adapted from Slevc et al., 2009) were sentences broken down into segments; each sentence segment was paired with a musical chord and presented at a fixed inter-onset interval. Linguistic syntax violations appeared in a garden-path design. During the critical region of the garden-path sentence, i.e. the particular segment in which the syntactic unexpectedness was processed, expectancy violations for language, music, and rhythm were each independently manipulated: musical expectation was manipulated by presenting out-of-key chords and rhythmic expectancy was manipulated by perturbing the fixed inter-onset interval such that the sentence segments and musical chords appeared either early or late. Reading times were recorded for each sentence segment and compared for linguistic, musical, and rhythmic expectancy. Results showed main effects of rhythmic expectancy and linguistic syntax expectancy on reading time. There was also an effect of rhythm on the interaction between musical and linguistic syntax: effects of violations in musical and linguistic syntax showed significant interaction only during rhythmically expected trials. To test the effects of our experimental design on rhythmic and linguistic expectancies, independently of musical syntax, Experiment 2 used the same experimental paradigm, but the musical factor was eliminated – linguistic stimuli were simply presented silently, and rhythmic expectancy was manipulated at the critical region. Experiment 2 replicated effects of rhythm and language, without an interaction. Together, results suggest that the interaction of music and language syntax processing depends on rhythmic expectancy, and support a merging of theories of music and language syntax processing with dynamic models of attentional entrainment.},

This method allowed us to identify moments in the music that produced similar brain activity (i.e. synchrony) among listeners under relatively natural listening conditions. Continuous ratings of subjective pleasantness and arousal elicited by the music were also obtained for the music outside of the scanner. Our results reveal synchronous activations in left amygdala, left insula and right caudate nucleus that were associated with higher arousal, whereas positive valence ratings correlated with decreases in amygdala and caudate activity. Additional analyses showed that synchronous amygdala responses were driven by energy-related features in the music such as root mean square and dissonance, while synchrony in insula was additionally sensitive to acoustic event density. Intersubject synchrony also occurred in the left nucleus accumbens, a region critically implicated in reward processing. Our study demonstrates the feasibility and usefulness of an approach based on ISC to explore the temporal dynamics of music perception and emotion in naturalistic conditions.},

The authors addressed this question by progressively characterizing music-induced emotions in 4 interrelated studies. Studies 1 and 2 (n ϭ 354) were conducted to compile a list of music-relevant emotion terms and to study the frequency of both felt and perceived emotions across 5 groups of listeners with distinct music preferences. Emotional responses varied greatly according to musical genre and type of response (felt vs. perceived). Study 3 (n ϭ 801)—a field study carried out during a music festival— examined the structure of music-induced emotions via confirmatory factor analysis of emotion ratings, resulting in a 9-factorial model of music-induced emotions. Study 4 (n ϭ 238) replicated this model and found that it accounted for music-elicited emotions better than the basic emotion and dimensional emotion models. A domain-specific device to measure musically induced emotions is introduced—the Geneva Emotional Music Scale.},

	abstract = {Neural encoding of abstract rules in the audition of newborn infants has been recently demonstrated in several studies using event-related potentials (ERPs). In the present study the neural encoding of Western music chords was investigated in newborn infants. Using ERPs, we examined whether the categorizations of major versus minor and consonance versus dissonance are present at the level of the change-related mismatch response (MMR). Using an oddball paradigm, root minor, dissonant and inverted major chords were presented in a context of consonant root major chords. The chords were transposed to several different frequency levels, so that the deviant chords did not include a physically deviant frequency that could result in an MMR without categorization. The results show that the newborn infants were sensitive to both dissonant and minor chords but not to inverted major chords in the context of consonant root major chords. While the dissonant chords elicited a large positive MMR, the minor chords elicited a negative MMR. This indicates that the two categories were processed differently. The results suggest newborn infants are sensitive to Western music categorizations, which is consistent with the authors’ previous studies in adults and school-aged children.},

For any non-trivial sequence of sounds, many alternative descriptions can be formed, only one or very few of which emerge in awareness at any time. Evidence from studies showing bi-/multistability in auditory streaming suggest that some, perhaps many of the alternative descriptions are represented in the brain in parallel and that they continuously vie for conscious perception. Here, based on a predictive coding view, we consider the nature of these sound representations and how they compete with each other. Predictive processing helps to maintain perceptual stability by signalling the continuation of previously established patterns as well as the emergence of new sound sources. It also provides a measure of how well each of the competing representations describes the current acoustic scene. This account of auditory stream segregation has been tested on perceptual data obtained in the auditory streaming paradigm.},

The segregation of concurrent sound streams is a crucial step in the path leading to the identification of objects in the environment.

	doi = {10.1016/j.tics.2009.09.003},
	abstract = {Predictive processing of information is essential for goal-directed behavior. We offer an account of auditory per-ception suggesting that representations of predictable patterns, or 'regularities', extracted from the incoming sounds serve as auditory perceptual objects. The audi-tory system continuously searches for regularities within the acoustic signal. Primitive regularities may be encoded by neurons adapting their response to specific sounds. Such neurons have been observed in many parts of the auditory system. Representations of the detected regularities produce predictions of upcom-ing sounds as well as alternative solutions for parsing the composite input into coherent sequences potentially emitted by putative sound sources. Accuracy of the predictions can be utilized for selecting the most likely interpretation of the auditory input. Thus in our view, perception generates hypotheses about the causal struc-ture of the world. Prediction underlies adaptive behavior Achieving one's goals in constantly changing environments requires actions directed at future states of the world. For example, when crossing a street, one has to anticipate the location of cars at the moment when one is likely to intersect their trajectories. Predicting future events is essential for everything we do, from taking into account the immediate sensory consequences of our own actions to signing up to a pension plan. The realization that we constantly interact with the future led to recent theoretical proposals for predictive descriptions of cognitive processes and their implementation in the brain in various domains of cognitive neuroscience. These theories are typically informed by concepts from Bayesian inference and consider that the 'purpose' of perception is to generate testable hypotheses about the causal structure of the external world, based both on prior knowledge and the current sensory input [1]. The various theories differ in their emphasis, spanning the range from cognitive, functional approaches [2,3] through approaches focusing on the two-way transfer of information along sensory hierarchies [4] to},

The model assumes that the ventral stream is largely bilaterally organized--although there are important computational differences between the left- and right-hemisphere systems--and that the dorsal stream is strongly left-hemisphere dominant.},

	abstract = {Nostalgia is an emotion that is most commonly associated with personally and socially relevant memories. It is primarily positive in valence and is readily evoked by music. It is also an idiosyncratic experience that varies between individuals based on affective traits. We identified frontal, limbic, paralimbic, and midbrain brain regions in which the strength of the relationship between ratings of nostalgia evoked by music and blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal was predicted by affective personality measures (nostalgia proneness and the sadness scale of the Affective Neuroscience Personality Scales) that are known to modulate the strength of nostalgic experiences. We also identified brain areas including the inferior frontal gyrus, substantia nigra, cerebellum, and insula in which time-varying BOLD activity correlated more strongly with the time-varying tonal structure of nostalgia-evoking music than with music that evoked no or little nostalgia. These findings illustrate one way in which the reward and emotion regulation networks of the brain are recruited during the experiencing of complex emotional experiences triggered by music. These findings also highlight the importance of considering individual differences when examining the neural responses to strong and idiosyncratic emotional experiences. Finally, these findings provide a further demonstration of the use of time-varying stimulus-specific information in the investigation of music-evoked experiences.},

	abstract = {The structure of Western musical pieces is delineated by several kinds of cadence. Half cadences in the main key indicate temporary endings; authentic cadences in the main key indicate definitive endings. Authentic cadences in the dominant key are of cognitive interest, since they mark a definitive ending at a local level but a temporary ending at a global level. This study investigated the local versus global processing of these cadences. Participants were presented with sections of 16-bar minuets displayed on a computer screen in the form of a musical jigsaw puzzle. The sections consisted of either the first or the second half of the minuet (8 bars each). The first section ended with either a half cadence in the main key (all experiments), an authentic cadence in the dominant key (all experiments), or an authentic cadence in the main key (Exp. 4). The second section always ended in an authentic cadence in the main key. Participants were asked either to join the two sections of each minuet in the most coherent order (Exps. 1, 2, 4) or to rate the perceived completion of each section (Exps. 3, 4). Numerous inversion errors were observed when the first section of the minuets ended with an authentic cadence in the dominant key. Completion judgments indicated that these cadences were perceived as marking a definitive ending. Both facts suggest that local processing of harmonic cadences prevails over global processing. This finding concurs with recent studies showing that listeners had great difficulties in perceiving the higher-order organization of musical form.},

Rule-governed number series, with the final number being a correct or incorrect series ending, were visually presented in synchrony with musical sequences, with the final chord functioning as the expected tonic or the less-expected subdominant chord (i.e., tonal function manipulation). Participants were asked to judge the correctness of the final number as quickly and accurately as possible. The results revealed an interaction between the processing of series ending and the processing of the task-irrelevant chords' tonal function, thus suggesting that music and arithmetic processing share cognitive resources. These findings are discussed in terms of general temporal and structural integration resources for linguistic and non-linguistic rule-governed sequences. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V..},

	abstract = {This article re-examines the concept of a ‘schema’ in light of a new body of empirical evidence regarding the culture and cognition of key in the eighteenth century.The schema concept in music, which originated in the work of Leonard B. Meyer, holds that social and historical experience gives rise to knowledge structures that engender a situated psychology of hearing and a context- contingent understanding of music. In previous studies by Meyer and Robert O. Gjerdingen, evidence for the schema concept has been advanced largely by interpreting a musical corpus as a metaphor for experience. That is, arguments for the existence of schemata as mental categories that configure a situated psychology of hearing have been presented primarily in the form of music analysis – historically situated patterns detected in musical scores. For this reason, the schema concept has remained, in Meyer’s and Gjerdingen’s words, a ‘hypothesis’ and ‘assum[ption]’ respectively.{\textbackslash}nThe evidence I advance here derives from a case study on Beethoven’s Eroica Symphony and what I call the le–sol–fi–sol schema. The study was conducted in the spirit of the psychologically orientated, humanistic music theory that char- acterises Meyer’s lifelong research program. By establishing a correlation between real listeners’ responses in the Symphony’s reception history and the details of my own corpus study of music from the long eighteenth century (1720–1840), my Eroica case study brings a novel perspective to the idea that schemata engender a historical mode of listening. The case study bears out several hypotheses that are basic to Meyer’s writings and perpetuated in Gjerdingen’s galant style project: (1) that replicated patternings in eighteenth- century works are commensurate with listeners’ knowledge structures; (2) that these knowledge structures are historically contingent and therefore engender a situated psychology of hearing; (3) that these situated psychologies are affected by style change; and (4) that schemata provide access to historical modes of listening today.},

	abstract = {Music is present in every culture, but the degree to which it is shaped by biology remains debated. One widely discussed phenomenon is that some combinations of notes are perceived by Westerners as pleasant, or consonant, whereas others are perceived as unpleasant, or dissonant 1 . The contrast between consonance and dissonance is central to Western music 2,3 , and its origins have fascinated scholars since the ancient Greeks 4–10 . Aesthetic responses to consonance are commonly assumed by scientists to have biological roots 11–14 , and thus to be universally present in humans 15,16 . Ethnomusicologists 17 and composers 8 , in contrast, have argued that consonance is a creation of Western musical culture 6 . The issue has remained unresolved, partly because little is known about the extent of cross-cultural variation in consonance preferences 18 . Here we report experiments with the Tsimane'—a native Amazonian society with minimal exposure to Western culture—and comparison populations in Bolivia and the United States that varied in exposure to Western music. Participants rated the pleasantness of sounds. Despite exhibiting Western-like discrimination abilities and Western-like aesthetic responses to familiar sounds and acoustic roughness, the Tsimane' rated consonant and dissonant chords and vocal harmonies as equally pleasant. By contrast, Bolivian city-and town-dwellers exhibited significant preferences for consonance, albeit to a lesser degree than US residents. The results indicate that consonance preferences can be absent in cultures sufficiently isolated from Western music, and are thus unlikely to reflect innate biases or exposure to harmonic natural sounds. The observed variation in preferences is presumably determined by exposure to musical harmony, suggesting that culture has a dominant role in shaping aesthetic responses to music. We conducted two studies to measure consonance preferences in populations with varying exposure to Western music. In Study 1, we measured preferences for sounds in residents of the United States and compared them to three populations in Bolivia: (1) residents of the capital city (La Paz); (2) residents of a rural town (San Borja); and (3) members of a native society of horticulturalist-foragers (the Tsimane') in a remote village (Santa Maria) in the Amazon rainforest. City-and town-dwellers were fluent in Spanish and generally had tele-visions and radios. By contrast, the Tsimane' were mostly monolingual in their own language, lacked televisions, and had limited access to music via radio 19 . The Tsimane' village lacked electricity and tap water, was inaccessible by road, and could be reached only by canoe (Fig. 1a). Their contact with Western culture was mainly limited to occasional trips to nearby towns. To compare differences between cultures to intra-cultural variation within Westerners, we tested two groups from the United States—one with at least two years of experience playing a musical instrument, and one with at most one year of experience. The Tsimane' were of particular interest because harmony, polyph-ony, and group performances are by all accounts absent from their music. This conclusion was suggested by previous recordings and documentation},

	abstract = {Music has existed in human societies since prehistory, perhaps because it allows expression and regulation of emotion and evokes pleasure. In this review, we present findings from cognitive neuroscience that bear on the question of how we get from perception of sound patterns to pleasurable responses. First, we identify some of the auditory cortical circuits that are responsible for encoding and storing tonal patterns and discuss evidence that cortical loops between auditory and frontal cortices are important for maintaining musical information in working memory and for the recognition of structural regularities in musical patterns, which then lead to expectancies. Second, we review evidence concerning the mesolimbic striatal system and its involvement in reward, motivation, and pleasure in other domains. Recent data indicate that this dopaminergic system mediates pleasure associated with music; specifically, reward value for music can be coded by activity levels in the nucleus accumbens, whose functional connectivity with auditory and frontal areas increases as a function of increasing musical reward. We propose that pleasure in music arises from interactions between cortical loops that enable predictions and expectancies to emerge from sound patterns and subcortical systems responsible for reward and valuation.},

	abstract = {We present the results of a study testing the often-theorized role of musical expectations in inducing listeners' emotions in a live flute concert experiment with 50 participants. Using an audience response system developed for this purpose, we measured subjective experience and peripheral psychophysiological changes continuously. To confirm the existence of the link between expectation and emotion, we used a threefold approach. (1) On the basis of an information-theoretic cognitive model, melodic pitch expectations were predicted by analyzing the musical stimuli used (six pieces of solo flute music). (2) A continuous rating scale was used by half of the audience to measure their experience of unexpectedness toward the music heard. (3) Emotional reactions were measured using a multicomponent approach: subjective feeling (valence and arousal rated continuously by the other half of the audience members), expressive behavior (facial EMG), and peripheral arousal (the latter two being measured in all 50 participants). Results confirmed the predicted relationship between high-information-content musical events, the violation of musical expectations (in corresponding ratings), and emotional reactions (psychologically and physiologically). Musical structures leading to expectation reactions were manifested in emotional reactions at different emotion component levels (increases in subjective arousal and autonomic nervous system activations). These results emphasize the role of musical structure in emotion induction, leading to a further understanding of the frequently experienced emotional effects of music.},

Here, we investigated how rhythmical patterns in music are processed in the human brain, and, in addition, evaluated the impact of musical training on rhythm processing. Using fMRI, we found that deviations from a rule-based regular rhythmic structure activated the left planum temporale together with Broca's area and its right-hemispheric homolog across subjects, that is, a network also crucially involved in the processing of harmonic structure in music and the syntactic analysis of language. Comparing the BOLD responses to rhythmic variations between professional jazz drummers and musical laypersons, we found that only highly trained rhythmic experts show additional activity in left-hemispheric supramarginal gyrus, a higher-order region involved in processing of linguistic syntax. This suggests an additional functional recruitment of brain areas usually dedicated to complex linguistic syntax processing for the analysis of rhythmical patterns only in professional jazz drummers, who are especially trained to use rhythmical cues for communication.},

	abstract = {Musical rhythm, consisting of apparently abstract intervals of accented temporal events, has a remarkable capacity to move our minds and bodies. How does the cognitive system enable our experiences of rhythmically complex music? In this paper, we describe some common forms of rhythmic complexity in music and propose the theory of predictive coding (PC) as a framework for understanding how rhythm and rhythmic complexity are processed in the brain. We also consider why we feel so compelled by rhythmic tension in music. First, we consider theories of rhythm and meter perception, which provide hierarchical and computational approaches to modeling. Second, we present the theory of PC, which posits a hierarchical organization of brain responses reflecting fundamental, survival-related mechanisms associated with predicting future events. According to this theory, perception and learning is manifested through the brain's Bayesian minimization of the error between the input to the brain and the brain's prior expectations. Third, we develop a PC model of musical rhythm, in which rhythm perception is conceptualized as an interaction between what is heard ("rhythm") and the brain's anticipatory structuring of music ("meter"). Finally, we review empirical studies of the neural and behavioral effects of syncopation, polyrhythm and groove, and propose how these studies can be seen as special cases of the PC theory. We argue that musical rhythm exploits the brain's general principles of prediction and propose that pleasure and desire for sensorimotor synchronization from musical rhythm may be a result of such mechanisms.},

Here we combine a music-classification scheme with sta- tistical analyses, including phylogenetic comparative methods, to examine a well-sampled global set of 304 music recordings. Our analyses reveal no absolute universals but strong support for many statistical universals that are consistent across all nine geo- graphic regions sampled. These universals include 18 musical fea- tures that are common individually as well as a network of 10 features that are commonly associated with one another. They span not only features related to pitch and rhythm that are often cited as putative universals but also rarely cited domains including per- formance style and social context. These cross-cultural structural reg- ularities of human music may relate to roles in facilitating group coordination and cohesion, as exemplified by the universal tendency to sing, play percussion instruments, and dance to simple, repetitive music in groups. Our findings highlight the need for scientists study- ing music evolution to expand the range of musical cultures and musical features under consideration. The statistical universals we identified represent important candidates for future investigation.},

	abstract = {Jazz pianist and composer Chick Corea’s compositions of the 1960s exhibit a range of innovative harmonic and tonal structures, from those works having a relatively close affinity with the bebop style to those featuring tonal ambiguity and passages of nonfunctional harmony. The harmonic content of four compositions is analyzed using methods suitable to each. “Windows” receives a real- time phenomenological approach with Roman numeral analysis, Schenkerian voice-leading graphs, and a “layered approach” originally developed for bebop harmony. The latter two methods are tried with “Litha,” but the layered approach particularly seems unsuitable, thereby revealing ways in which its harmonic orientation differs from that of the bebop style. A review of general principles of organization for passages of nonfunctional harmony, including linear intervallic patterns, equal divi- sions of tonal space, the transposition operation, Neo-Riemannian operations, and other contextual operations (the latter two as plotted on a Tonnetz) leads to a new view of “Litha” and passages from three other compositions, “Tones for Joan’s Bones,”“Steps,” and “Now He Sings, Now He Sobs.”},

This paper brings to mind several arguments to elucidate that this presumption is ill-conceived and unwarranted in light of what is currently understood about the physical principles underlying mental achievements. It then scrutinizes the question why nevertheless such conceptions are currently prevailing in many areas of psychology. The paper argues that neuroreductionist conceptions are rooted in four different aspects of our common-sense conception of mental phenomena and their explanation that are illegitimately transferred to scientific inquiry. These four aspects pertain to the notion of explanation, to conceptions about which mental phenomena are singled out for inquiry, to an inductivist epistemology, and, in the wake of behavioristic conceptions, to a bias favoring investigations of input-output relations at the expense of inquiries into internal principles. To the extent that the cognitive neurosciences methodologically adhere to these tacit assumptions, they are prone to turn into a largely atheoretical and data-driven endeavour while at the same time receiving wide-spread public appreciation of their empirical findings.

The paper proposes a simple information-theoretic characterization of processing difficulty as the work incurred by resource reallocation during parallel, incremental, probabilistic disambiguation in sentence comprehension, and demonstrates its equivalence to the theory of Hale [Hale, J. (2001). A probabilistic Earley parser as a psycholinguistic model. In Proceedings of NAACL (Vol. 2, pp. 159-166)], in which the difficulty of a word is proportional to its surprisal (its negative log-probability) in the context within which it appears. This proposal subsumes and clarifies findings that high-constraint contexts can facilitate lexical processing, and connects these findings to well-known models of parallel constraint-based comprehension. In addition, the theory leads to a number of specific predictions about the role of expectation in syntactic comprehension, including the reversal of locality-based difficulty patterns in syntactically constrained contexts, and conditions under which increased ambiguity facilitates processing. The paper examines a range of established results bearing on these predictions, and shows that they are largely consistent with the surprisal theory. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The results of the body of work suggest that referential context effects are not limited to situations in which the linguistic form of the utterance directly specifies the point of contact with context. Rather, context effects of a pragmatic, Gricean nature appear to be possible, suggesting the relationship between linguistic form and context in rapid on-line processing can be of a very indirect nature.},

A single multilevel logit model analysis of naturally distributed data from a corpus of spontaneous speech is used to assess the effect of information density on complementizer that-mentioning, while simultaneously evaluating the predictions of several influential alternative accounts: availability, ambiguity avoidance, and dependency processing accounts. Information density emerges as an important predictor of speakers' preferences during production. As information is defined in terms of probabilities, it follows that production is probability-sensitive, in that speakers' preferences are affected by the contextual probability of syntactic structures. The merits of a corpus-based approach to the study of language production are discussed as well. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

This article describes a visual-world study investigating how and when perceivers compute these inferences. Participants followed spoken instructions containing the scalar quantifier some directing them to interact with one of several referential targets (e.g., Click on the girl who has some of the balloons). Participants fixated on the target compatible with the implicated meaning of some and avoided a competitor compatible with the literal meaning prior to a disambiguating noun. Further, convergence on the target was as fast for some as for the non-scalar quantifiers none and all. These findings indicate that the scalar inference is computed immediately and is not delayed relative to the literal interpretation of some. It is argued that previous demonstrations that scalar inferences increase processing time are not necessarily due to delays in generating the inference itself, but rather arise because integrating the interpretation of the inference with relevant information in the context may require additional time. With sufficient contextual support, processing delays disappear. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

We argue that, to deal with this "Now-or-Never" bottleneck, the brain must compress and recode linguistic input as rapidly as possible. This observation has strong implications for the nature of language processing: (i) the language system must "eagerly" recode and compress linguistic input; (ii) as the bottleneck recurs at each new representational level, the language system must build a multi-level linguistic representation; and (iii) it must deploy all available information predictively to ensure that local linguistic ambiguities are dealt with "Right-First-Time;" once the original input is lost, there is no way for the language system to recover. This is "Chunk-and-Pass" processing. Similarly, language learning must also occur in the here-and-now. This implies that language acquisition is learning to process, rather than inducing a grammar. Moreover, this perspective provides a cognitive foundation for grammaticalization and other aspects of language change. Chunk-and-Pass processing also helps explain a variety of core properties of language, including its multi-level representational structure and duality of patterning. This approach promises to create a direct relationship between psycholinguistics and linguistic theory. More generally, we outline a framework within which to integrate often disconnected inquiries into language processing, language acquisition, and language change and evolution.},

Throughout the book, Sipser - a noted authority on the theory of computation - builds students' knowledge of conceptual tools used in computer science, the aesthetic sense they need to create elegant systems, and the ability to think through problems on their own. INTRODUCTION TO THE THEORY OF COMPUTATION provides a mathematical treatment of computation theory grounded in theorems and proofs. Proofs are presented with a "proof idea" component to reveal the concepts underpinning the formalism. Algorithms are presented using prose instead of pseudocode to focus attention on the algorithms themselves, rather than on specific computational models. Topic coverage, terminology, and order of presentation are traditional for an upper-level course in computer science theory. Users of the Preliminary Edition (now out of print) will be interested to note several new chapters on complexity theory: Chapter 8 on space complexity; Chapter 9 on provable intractability, and Chapter 10 on advanced topics, including approximation algorithms, alternation, interactive proof systems, cryptography, and parallel computing."--Publisher's description.},

We reevaluate one version of this argument with a Bayesian model of grammar induction, and show that a rational learner without any initial language-specific biases could learn this dependency given typical child-directed input. This choice enables the learner to master aspects of syntax, such as the auxiliary fronting rule in interrogative formation, even without having heard directly relevant data (e.g., interrogatives containing an auxiliary in a relative clause in the subject NP).},

	abstract = {Music, like speech, is a complex auditory signal that contains structures at multiple timescales, and as such is a potentially powerful entry point into the question of how the brain integrates complex streams of information. Using an experimental design modeled after previous studies that used scrambled versions of a spoken story (Lerner et al., 2011) and a silent movie (Hasson et al., 2008), we investigate whether listeners perceive hierarchical structure in music beyond short ({\textasciitilde}6 s) time windows and whether there is cortical overlap between music and language processing at multiple timescales. Experienced pianists were presented with an extended musical excerpt scrambled at multiple timescales-by measure, phrase, and section-while measuring brain activity with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The reliability of evoked activity, as quantified by inter-subject correlation of the fMRI responses, was measured. We found that response reliability depended systematically on musical structure coherence, revealing a topographically organized hierarchy of processing timescales. Early auditory areas (at the bottom of the hierarchy) responded reliably in all conditions. For brain areas at the top of the hierarchy, the original (unscrambled) excerpt evoked more reliable responses than any of the scrambled excerpts, indicating that these brain areas process long-timescale musical structures, on the order of minutes. The topography of processing timescales was analogous with that reported previously for speech, but the timescale gradients for music and speech overlapped with one another only partially, suggesting that temporally analogous structures-words/measures, sentences/musical phrases, paragraph/sections-are processed separately.},

If a child could understand speakers’ utterances, it would be easy to learn the meanings of individual words, and once a child knows what many words mean, it is easy to infer speakers’ intended meanings. To the beginning learner, however, both individual word meanings and speakers’ intentions are unknown. We describe a com- putational model of word learning that solves these two inference problems in parallel, rather than relying exclu- sively on either the inferred meanings of utterances or cross-situational word-meaning associations. We tested our model using annotated corpus data and found that it inferred pairings between words and object concepts with higher precision than comparison models. Moreover, as the result of making probabilistic inferences about speak- ers’ intentions, our model explains a variety of behavioral phenomena described in the word-learning literature. These phenomena include mutual exclusivity, one-trial learning, cross-situational learning, the role of words in object individuation, and the use of inferred intentions to disambiguate reference.},

These new data present significant problems for nativist accounts of children's language development that use adult-like linguistic categories, structures and formal grammars as analytical tools. Instead, the best account of these data is provided by a usage-based model in which children imitatively learn concrete linguistic expressions from the language they hear around them, and then - using their general cognitive and social-cognitive skills - categorize, schematize and creatively combine these individually learned expressions and structures.

The theory explains how learners can generalize meaningfully from just one or a few positive examples of a novel word's referents, by making rational inductive inferences that integrate prior knowledge about plausible word meanings with the statistical structure of the observed examples. The theory addresses shortcomings of the two best known approaches to modeling word learning, based on deductive hypothesis elimination and associative learning. Three experiments with adults and children test the Bayesian account's predictions in the context of learning words for object categories at multiple levels of a taxonomic hierarchy. Results provide strong support for the Bayesian account over competing accounts, in terms of both quantitative model fits and the ability to explain important qualitative phenomena. Several extensions of the basic theory are discussed, illustrating the broader potential for Bayesian models of word learning.},

We report an experiment replicating the results of F\&H in humans but also showing that sub- jects learned the language without exploiting in any way the center-embedded structure. When the pro- cedure was modified to make the processing of this structure mandatory, the subjects no longer showed evidence of learning. We propose a simple interpretation for the difference in performance ob- served in F\&H’s task between humans and tamarins and argue that, beyond the specific drawbacks in- herent in F\&H’s study, researching the source of the inability of nonhuman primates to master language within a framework built around Chomsky’s hierarchy of grammars is a conceptual dead end.},

The map is used to represent dynamic changes in the sense of key as cues to key become more or less clear and modulations occur. Two models, one using tone distributions and the other using tone transitions, are proposed for key-finding. The tone transition model takes both pitch and temporal distance between tones into account. Both models produce results highly comparable to those of musically trained listeners, who performed a probe tone task for ten nine-chord sequences. A distributed mapping of tonality is used to visualize activation patterns that change over time. The location and spread of this activation pattern is similar for experimental results and the key-finding model.},

With contributions from over fifty experts in the field, the range and depth of coverage is unequalled. All the chapters combine a solid review of the relevant literature with well-reasoned arguments and robust discussions of the major findings, as well as original insights and suggestions for future work. Written by leading experts, the 52 chapters are divided into 11 sections covering both experimental and theoretical perspectives, each edited by an internationally recognised authority Ten sections each present chapters that focus on specific areas of music psychology: - the origins and functions of music - music perception - responses to music - music and the brain - musical development - learning musical skills - musical performance - composition and improvisation - the role of music in our everyday lives - music therapy and conceptual frameworks In each section, expert authors critically review the literature, highlight current issues, and explore possibilities for the future. The final section examines how in recent years the study of music psychology has broadened to include a range of other scientific disciplines. It considers the way that the research has developed in relation to technological advances, fostering links across the field and providing an overview of the areas where the field needs further development in the future.

	abstract = {For humans, learning abstract concepts and learning language go hand in hand: we acquire abstract knowl-edge primarily through linguistic experience, and ac-quiring abstract concepts is a crucial step in learning the meanings of linguistic expressions. Number knowl-edge is a case in point: we largely acquire concepts such as seventy-three through linguistic means, and we can only know what the sentence " seventy-three is more than twice as big as thirty-one " means if we can grasp the meanings of its component number words. How do we begin to solve this problem? One approach is to es-timate the distribution from which sentences are drawn, and, in doing so, infer the latent concepts and relation-ships that best explain those sentences. We present early work on a learning framework called Latent Predicate Networks (LPNs) which learns concepts by inferring the parameters of probabilistic context-sensitive gram-mars over sentences. We show that for a small frag-ment of sentences expressing relationships between En-glish number words, we can use hierarchical Bayesian inference to learn grammars that can answer simple queries about previously unseen relationships within this domain. These generalizations demonstrate LPNs' promise as a tool for learning and representing concep-tual knowledge in language.},

	abstract = {Musical behaviours are universal across human populations and, at the same time, highly diverse in their structures, roles and cultural interpretations. Although laboratory studies of isolated listeners and music-makers have yielded important insights into sensorimotor and cognitive skills and their neural underpinnings, they have revealed little about the broader significance of music for individuals, peer groups and communities. This review presents a sampling of musical forms and coordinated musical activity across cultures, with the aim of highlighting key similarities and differences. The focus is on scholarly and everyday ideas about music--what it is and where it originates--as well the antiquity of music and the contribution of musical behaviour to ritual activity, social organization, caregiving and group cohesion. Synchronous arousal, action synchrony and imitative behaviours are among the means by which music facilitates social bonding. The commonalities and differences in musical forms and functions across cultures suggest new directions for ethnomusicology, music cognition and neuroscience, and a pivot away from the predominant scientific focus on instrumental music in the Western European tradition.},

The emerging third generation of activity theory takes two interacting activity systems as its minimal unit of analysis, inviting us to focus research efforts on the challenges and possibilities of inter-organizational learning. Activity theory and its concept of expansive learning are examined with the help of four questions: 1. Who are the subjects of learning? 2. Why do they learn? 3. What do they learn? 4. How do they learn? Five central principles of activity theory are presented, namely activity system as unit of analysis, multi-voicedness of activity, historicity of activity, contradictions as driving force of change in activity, and expansive cycles as possible form of transformation in activity. Together the four questions and five principles form a matrix which is used to present a study of expansive learning in a hospital setting in Finland. In conclusion, implications of the framework for our understanding of the increasingly important horizontal dimension of learning are discussed.},

Scholarly interest in associations between music training and nonmusical cognitive functioning has sparked much research over the past 15–20 years. The study of how far associations between music training and cognitive abilities extend, and whether such associations are more likely for some domains of cognition than for others, has theoretical relevance for issues of transfer, modularity, and plasticity. Unlike most other areas of scientific inquiry, there is parallel interest on the part of the public, the media, and educators who want to know if nonmusical intellectual and academic benefits are a welcome by-product of sending children to music lessons. Indeed, some educators and arts advocates justify music training in schools precisely because of these presumed and desired nonmusical associations.},

In particular, we argue that the P600 indexes error correction and ensues whenever the probability that the received message was corrupted by noise (due to production or perception errors) exceeds the probability that it was produced intentionally and perceived accurately. We report an ERP experiment that shows that semantic violations that can be explained by a plausible noise process elicit a P600 effect. For example, in a sentence like “The storyteller could turn any incident into an amusing antidote”, the intended word (“anecdote”) is recoverable because it is phonologically and orthographically close to antidote, and is thus a likely erroneous substitution.},

Both problems are intertwined, as with few training examples, increasing the complexity of the model would inevitably lead to overfitting. In this paper we develop a way to address the first problem by exploiting chord annotations from online chord data- bases. We show how such chord annotations, despite being noisy and lacking exact chord onset times, can be put to use both during the recognition and training stage. We note that the ability to exploit this large untapped resource may enable researchers to also address the second problem: with more training data, one may be able to use more complex models without running the same high risk of overfitting},

The dominant-tonic progression, known as an authentic cadence, is often used as a marker of the end of a harmonic progression and has been considered a basic syntactic structure of major-minor tonal music by several music theorists and music psychologists. We review data from studies in which brain responses to an authentic cadence were compared to those elicited by music-syntactically inappropriate endings. In event-related electric brain potentials (recorded with EEG), the inappropriate endings elicit early right anterior negativity (ERAN), which is maximal around 200 ms after the presentation of an inappropriate chord. The ERAN is reminiscent of early anterior negativities elicited by syntactic incongruities during the perception of language. Magnetoencephalographic (MEG) data suggest that the ERAN is generated in the inferior frontolateral cortex, an area known to be crucially involved in the processing of (linguistic) syntax. Interestingly, the ERAN can be recorded in nonmusicians and in children, indicating that the ability to acquire (implicit) knowledge about musical regularities and to process musical information according to this knowledge is a general ability of the human brain. This ability is probably of great importance for the acquisition of language in infants and children.},

It determines the range of grammatical hypothesis that children entertain during language learning and the procedure they use for evaluating input sentences. How universal grammar arose is a major challenge for evolutionary biology. We present a mathematical framework for the evolutionary dynamics of grammar learning. The central result is a coherence threshold, which specifies the condition for a universal grammar to induce coherent communication within a population. We study selection of grammars within the same universal grammar and competition between different universal grammars. We calculate the condition under which natural selection favors the emergence of rule-based, generative grammars that underlie complex language.},

We argue that the GE approach to language comprehension is similar to the use of fast and frugal heuristics for decision-making, and that future research should explore this connection more thoroughly.},

However, the nature of the shared resources has remained ambiguous. They have been argued to be syntax specific and thus due to shared syntactic integration resources. An alternative view regards them as related to general attention and, thus, not specific to syntax. The present experiments evaluated these accounts by investigating the influence of language on music. Participants were asked to provide closure judgements on harmonic sequences in order to assess the appropriateness of sequence endings. At the same time participants read syntactic garden-path sentences. Closure judgements revealed a change in harmonic processing as the result of reading a syntactically challenging word. We found no influence of an arithmetic control manipulation (experiment 1) or semantic garden-path sentences (experiment 2). Our results provide behavioural evidence for a specific influence of linguistic syntax processing on musical harmony judgements. A closer look reveals that the shared resources appear to be needed to hold a harmonic key online in some form of syntactic working memory or unification workspace related to the integration of chords and words. Overall, our results support the syntax specificity of shared music–language processing resources.},

We further show that these regions are sensitive to the scrambling of both pitch and rhythmic structure but are insensitive to high-level linguistic structure.

The present experiments address this issue by simultaneously manipulating syntactic processing demands in language and music. Participants performed self-paced reading of garden path sentences, in which structurally unexpected words cause temporary syntactic processing difficulty. A musical chord accompanied each sentence segment, with the resulting sequence forming a coherent chord progression. When structurally unexpected words were paired with harmonically unexpected chords, participants showed substantially enhanced garden path effects. No such interaction was observed when the critical words violated semantic expectancy or when the critical chords violated timbral expectancy. These results support a prediction of the shared syntactic integration resource hypothesis (Patel, 2003), which suggests that music and language draw on a common pool of limited processing resources for integrating incoming elements into syntactic structures.

We present a Bayesian model to explain why this reduced discriminability might occur: It arises as a consequence of optimally solving the statistical problem of perception in noise. In the optimal solution to this problem, listeners' perception is biased toward phonetic category means because they use knowledge of these categories to guide their inferences about speakers' target productions. Simulations show that model predictions closely correspond to previously published human data, and novel experimental results provide evidence for the predicted link between perceptual warping and noise. The model unifies several previous accounts of the perceptual magnet effect and provides a framework for exploring categorical effects in other domains.},

Existing theories of rhythmic structure are often restricted to music as it is notated in a score, and as a result are bound to refrain from making statements about music as it is perceived and appreciated by listeners. This paper outlines a cognitive approach to the study of rhythm and timing that allows for making scientific observations and statements about ‘sounding’ music, music as it is performed and listened to. This approach was developed over the last few years in the context of the Music, Mind, Machine project at the Nijmegen Institute for Cognition of Information. In addition, the notion of rhythm space (the set of all possible performed rhythms) is elaborated into a systematic method for the investigation of the relation between rhythmic structure, expressive timing and tempo. As such the paper presents a research program that aims to develop a theory of music incorporating both the structural and perceptual aspects of musical time.},

Although these evaluations of intuitive relative judgments are valuable, they do not justify the use of nonquantitative linguistic methods. We argue that objectivity is a universal value in science that should be adopted by linguistics. In addition, the reliability measures that S\&A report are not sufficient for developing sophisticated linguistic theories. Furthermore, quantitative methods yield two additional benefits: consistency of judgments across many pairs of judgments; and an understanding of the relative effect sizes across sets of judgments. We illustrate these points with an experiment that demonstrates five clear levels of acceptability. Finally, we observe that S\&A's experiments—where only two authors evaluated 10 years' worth of journal articles and one standard textbook within a few months—further emphasise one of our critical original points: conducting behavioural experiments is in many respects easy and fast with the advent of online research tools like Amazon's Mechanical Turk.

Music-syntactically regular and irregular chord functions were presented synchronously with syntactically correct or incorrect words, or with words that had either a high or a low semantic cloze probability. Music-syntactically irregular chords elicited an early right anterior negativity (ERAN). Syntactically incorrect words elicited a left anterior negativity (LAN). The LAN was clearly reduced when words were presented simultaneously with music-syntactically irregular chord functions. Processing of high and low cloze-probability words as indexed by the N400 was not affected by the presentation of irregular chord functions. In a control experiment, the LAN was not affected by physically deviant tones that elicited a mismatch negativity (MMN). Results demonstrate that processing of musical syntax (as reflected in the ERAN) interacts with the processing of linguistic syntax (as reflected in the LAN), and that this interaction is not due to a general effect of deviance-related negativities that precede an LAN. Findings thus indicate a strong overlap of neural resources involved in the processing of syntax in language and music.},

The present study investigated what kinds of subjective emotional experi- ences are induced in listeners by sad music, and whether the tendency to enjoy sad music is associated with particular personality traits. One hundred forty-eight participants listened to 16 music excerpts and rated their emotional responses. As expected, sadness was the most salient emotion experienced in response to sad excerpts. However, other more positive and complex emotions such as nostalgia, peacefulness, and wonder were also evident. Furthermore, two personality traits – Openness to Experience and Empathy – were associated with liking for sad music and with the intensity of emotional responses induced by sad music, suggesting that aesthetic appreciation and empathetic engagement play a role in the enjoyment of sad music.},

Music, by contrast, can be defined as a social and cultural construct based on that very musicality. One critical challenge is to delineate the constituent elements of musicality. What biological and cognitive mechanisms are essential for perceiving, appreciating and making music? Progress in understanding the evolution of music cognition depends upon adequate characterization of the constituent mechanisms of musicality and the extent to which they are present in non-human species. We argue for the importance of identifying these mechanisms and delineating their functions and developmental course, as well as suggesting effective means of studying them in human and non-human animals. It is virtually impossible to underpin the evolutionary role of musicality as a whole, but a multicomponent perspective on musicality that emphasizes its constituent capacities, development and neural cognitive specificity is an excellent starting point for a research programme aimed at illuminating the origins and evolution of musical behaviour as an autonomous trait.},

This study derives from work that suggests overlap between the neural and cognitive resources underlying the analyses of both music and speech and is the first, to our knowledge, to explore the timescales at which the brain infers musical key. We investigated the temporal psychophysics of key-finding over a wide range of tempi using melodic sequences with strong structural cues, where statistical information about overall key profile was ambiguous. Listeners were able to provide robust judgments within specific limits, at rates as high as 400 beats per minute (bpm; ∼7 Hz) and as low as 30 bpm (0.5 Hz), but not outside those bounds. These boundaries on reliable performance show that the process of key-finding is restricted to timescales that are closely aligned with beat induction and speech processing.},

As described on the Congress website;"As a discipline which is involved in the designing of the interactions among humans and other elements of a system, ergonomics must consider "sustainability" as a key aspect in optimizing resources to improve human well-being and overall system performance. So, one of the major challenges in the field of ergonomics for the 21st Century will be the design and management of systems that satisfy custom demands in terms of the requirements for human compatibility and at the same time consider sustainability" (www.iea2012.org).The Congress papers contained in this supplement are a global snap shot of the science-driven and evidence based research and scholarly work being conducted by practitioners, scientists, researchers, academicians, and students. All papers are indexed with DOI numbers so they can be easily accessed and will add to the growing body of evidence in ergonomics.It has been my pleasure to be part of the IEA's Executive Committee and the Organizing Committee of this Congress during Dr. Andy Imada's term as President.

We claim that the major distinction is that, while both Connectionist and Classical architectures postulate representational mental states, the latter but not the former are committed to a symbol-level of representation, or to a 'language of thought': i.e., to representational states that have combinatorial syntactic and semantic structure. Several arguments for combinatorial structure in mental representations are then reviewed. These include arguments based on the 'systematicity' of mental representation: i.e., on the fact that cognitive capacities always exhibit certain symmetries, so that the ability to entertain a given thought implies the ability to entertain thoughts with semantically related contents. We claim that such arguments make a powerful case that mind/brain architecture is not Connectionist at the cognitive level. We then consider the possibility that Connectionism may provide an account of the neural (or 'abstract neurological') structures in which Classical cognitive architecture is implemented. We survey a number of the standard arguments that have been offered in favor of Connectionism, and conclude that they are coherent only on this interpretation. ?? 1988.},

To use reinforcement learning successfully in situations approaching real-world complexity, however, agents are confronted with a difficult task: they must derive efficient representations of the environment from high-dimensional sensory inputs, and use these to generalize past experience to new situations. Remarkably, humans and other animals seem to solve this problem through a harmonious combination of reinforcement learning and hierarchical sensory pro-cessing systems 4,5 , the former evidenced by a wealth of neural data revealing notable parallels between the phasic signals emitted by dopa-minergic neurons and temporal difference reinforcement learning algorithms 3 . While reinforcement learning agents have achieved some successes in a variety of domains 6–8 , their applicability has previously been limited to domains in which useful features can be handcrafted, or to domains with fully observed, low-dimensional state spaces. Here we use recent advances in training deep neural networks 9–11 to develop a novel artificial agent, termed a deep Q-network, that can learn successful policies directly from high-dimensional sensory inputs using end-to-end reinforcement learning.

Degradation of semantic knowledge occurs through degradation of the patterns of neural activity that probe the knowledge stored in the connections.

	abstract = {The encounter of a musical repertoire with a theoretical system benefits the latter even as it serves the former. A robustly applied theoretic apparatus hones our appreciation of a given corpus, especially one such as film music, for which comparatively little analytical attention has been devoted. Just as true, if less frequently offered as an motivator for analysis, is the way in which the chosen music theoretical system stands to see its underlying assumptions clarified and its practical resources enhanced by such contact. The innate programmaticism and aesthetic immediacy of film music makes it especially suited to enrich a number of theoretical practices. A habit particularly ripe for this exposure is tonal hermeneutics: the process of interpreting music through its harmonic relationships. Interpreting cinema through harmony not only sharpens our understanding of various film music idioms, but considerably refines the critical machinery behind its analysis.{\textbackslash}nThe theoretical approach focused on here is transformation theory, a system devised for analysis of art music (particularly from the 19th Century) but nevertheless eminently suited for film music. By attending to the perceptually salient changes, rather than static objects, of musical discourse, transformation theory avoids some of the bugbears of conventional tonal hermeneutics for film (such as the tyranny of the ``15 second rule'') while remaining exceptionally well-calibrated towards musical structure and detail. By examining a handful of passages from films with chromatically convoluted scores---Raiders of the Lost Ark, King Kong, and A Beautiful Mind---I reveal some of the conceptual assumptions of transformational theory while simultaneously interpreting the scenes and films that these cues occupy. Ultimately, it is the notion of ``transformation'' itself---as a theoretical keystone, an analytical stance, and an immanent quality of music---that is most elucidated through this approach.},

For example, simple correlations between mode (major vs. minor) and emotion (happy vs. sad) do not adequately explain the enormous range, subtlety or complexity of musically induced emotions. In this study, we examined the structural features of unconstrained musical improvisations generated by jazz pianists in response to emotional cues. We hypothesized that musicians would not utilize any universal rules to convey emotions, but would instead combine heterogeneous musical elements together in order to depict positive and negative emotions. Our findings demonstrate a lack of simple correspondence between emotions and musical features of spontaneous musical improvisation. While improvisations in response to positive emotional cues were more likely to be in major keys, have faster tempos, faster key press velocities and more staccato notes when compared to negative improvisations, there was a wide distribution for each emotion with components that directly violated these primary associations. The finding that musicians often combine disparate features together in order to convey emotion during improvisation suggests that structural diversity may be an essential feature of the ability of music to express a wide range of emotion.},

Here we report the synthesis and activity of the beta,beta-difluorophenylalanyl derivative of puromycin, an A-site substrate. The fluorine atoms reduce the pK(a) of the nucleophilic alpha-amino group ({\textless}5.0) such that it is deprotonated at all pHs amenable to ribosomal analysis (pH 5.2-9.5). In the 50S modified fragment assay, this substrate reacts substantially faster than puromycin at neutral or acidic pH. The reaction follows a simplified pH profile that is dependent only upon deprotonation of a titratable group within the ribosomal active site. This feature will simplify characterization of the peptidyl transferase reaction mechanism. On the basis of the reaction efficiency of the doubly fluorinated substrate compared to the unfluorinated derivative, the Bronsted coefficient for the nucleophile is estimated to be substantially smaller than that reported for uncatalyzed aminolysis reactions, which has important mechanistic implications for the peptidyl transferase reaction.},

This view is largely due to the nature of conventional rivalry-inducing stimuli, which are pairs of dissimilar images with coherent patterns within each eye's image. Is it the eye of origin or the coherency of patterns that determines perceptual alternations between coherent percepts in binocular rivalry? We break the coherency of conventional stimuli and replace them by complementary patchworks of intermingled rivalrous images. Can the brain unscramble the pieces of the patchwork arriving from different eyes to obtain coherent percepts? We find that pattern coherency in itself can drive perceptual alternations, and the patchworks are reassembled into coherent forms by most observers. This result is in agreement with recent neurophysiological and psychophysical evidence demonstrating that there is more to binocular rivalry than mere eye competition.},

	abstract = {In monkeys, a number of different neocortical as well as limbic structures have cell populations that respond preferentially to face stimuli. Face selectivity is also differentiated within itself: Cells in the inferior temporal and prefrontal cortex tend to respond to facial identity, others in the upper bank of the superior temporal sulcus to gaze directions, and yet another population in the amygdala to facial expression. The great majority of these cells are sensitive to the entire configuration of a face. Changing the spatial arrangement of the facial features greatly diminishes the neurons’ response. It would appear, then, that an entire neural network for faces exists which contains units highly selective to complex configurations and that respond to different aspects of the object “face.”Given the vital importance of face recognition in primates, this may not come as a surprise. But are faces the only objects represented in this way? Behavioural work in humans suggests that nonface objects may be processed like faces if subjects are required to discriminate between visually similar exemplars and acquire sufficient expertise in doing so. Recent neuroimaging studies in humans indicate that level of categorisation and expertise interact to produce the specialisation for faces in the middle fusiform gyrus. Here we discuss some new evidence in themonkey suggesting that any arbitrary homogeneous class of artificial objects—which the animal has to individually learn, remember, and recognise again and again from among a large number of distractors sharing a number of common features with the target—can induce configurational selectivity in the response of neurons in the visual system. For all of the animals tested, the neurons from which we recorded were located in the anterior inferotemporal cortex. However, as we have only recorded fromthe posterior and anterior ventrolateral temporal lobe, other cells with a similar selectivity for the same objects may also exist in areas of the medial temporal lobe or in the limbic structures of the same “expert” monkeys. It seems that the encoding scheme used for faces may also be employed for other classes with similar properties. Thus, regarding their neural encoding, faces are not “special” but rather the “default special” class in the primate recognition system.},

Patient TN suffered two strokes in succession, lesioning each visual cortex in turn and causing clinical blindness over his whole visual field. Functional and anatomical brain imaging assessments showed that TN completely lacks any functional visual cortex. We report here that, among other retained abilities, he can successfully navigate down the extent of a long corridor in which various barriers were placed. A video recording shows him skillfully avoiding and turning around the blockages. This demonstrates that extra-striate pathways in humans can sustain sophisticated visuo-spatial skills in the absence of perceptual awareness, akin to what has been previously reported in monkeys. It remains to be determined which of the several extra-striate pathways account for TN's intact navigation skills. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The relationship between structural processing in music and language has received increasing interest in the past several years, spurred by the influential Shared Syntactic Integration Resource Hypothesis (SSIRH; Patel, Nature Neuroscience, 6, 674-681, 2003). According to this resource-sharing framework, music and language rely on separable syntactic representations but recruit shared cognitive resources to integrate these representations into evolving structures. The SSIRH is supported by findings of interactions between structural manipulations in music and language. However, other recent evidence suggests that such interactions also can arise with nonstructural manipulations, and some recent neuroimaging studies report largely nonoverlapping neural regions involved in processing musical and linguistic structure. These conflicting results raise the question of exactly what shared (and distinct) resources underlie musical and linguistic structural processing. This paper suggests that one shared resource is prefrontal cortical mechanisms of cognitive control, which are recruited to detect and resolve conflict that occurs when expectations are violated and interpretations must be revised. By this account, musical processing involves not just the incremental processing and integration of musical elements as they occur, but also the incremental generation of musical predictions and expectations, which must sometimes be overridden and revised in light of evolving musical input.},

A model is proposed in which the acceptability of a string is based on the most probable combination of natural classes that it instantiates. The model is tested on its ability to predict acceptability ratings of nonce words, and its predictions are compared against those of models that lack features or economise on feature specifications. The proposed model achieves the best balance of performance on attested and un- attested sequences, and is a significant predictor of acceptability even after the other models are factored out. The feature-based model’s predictions do not completely subsume those of simpler models, however. This may indicate mul- tiple levels of evaluation, involving segment-based phonotactic probability and feature-based gradient phonological grammaticality.},

	isbn = {978-0-262-53097-2},
	abstract = {(Preface) This book is organized in the following way. Part I opens with an introductory chapter, Chapter One, in which background assumptions are briefly sketched. In Chapter Two of Part I our major conclusions with respect to phonological theory and the phonology of English are outlined. Also discussed are the possible implications of this work with regard to perceptual processes and the conditions under which knowledge of a language (and, presumably, knowledge of other sorts) can be acquired. Part II of the book is an elaboration of the topics treated in Chapter Two of Part I. Chapters Three and Four examine in considerable detail two aspects of English sound structure which were only sketched in Chapter Two. In the course of this detailed investigation of English sound patterns and their underlying structure, certain rules of English phonology are developed. These rules are restated in Chapter Five, which concludes Part Two. The primary emphasis in Part II is on the phonology of English; theory is developed informally as needed for the exposition and analysis. Part III deals with certain aspects of the historical evolution of the sound patterns revealed in the synchronic study in Part II. Part IV is devoted to phonological theory. The informal discussion in Part I is expanded upon, and the theory presented in an ad hoc manner in Part II is systematically developed. The first chapter of Part IV-Chapter Seven-is concerned with universal phonetics, that is, with the general theory of linguistic representation of speech signals. Chapter Eight deals with the principles of organization of the phonological component of the grammar, that is, with the rules that relate syntactic structures to phonetically represented speech signals. In the ninth and concluding chapter, a proposal is presented for an extension of phonological theory that takes into account the intrinsic content of features. Part IV is not concerned with the structure of English but is intended rather as a contribution to universal grammar. In writing the book we have had two classes of potential readers in mind: first, readers who are concerned only with the general properties of English sound structure, with the consequences of these properties for general linguistic theory, and with the implications of general linguistic theory for other fields; second, readers who are concerned with the detailed development of phonological theory and the theory of English, that is, English grammar. Part I of the book is directed to the first class of readers; Parts II, III, and IV, to the second.},

	abstract = {A probabilistic phonotactic grammar based on the probabilities of the constituents contained in a dictionary of English was used to generate multisyllabic nonwords. English-speaking listeners evaluated the wordlikeness of these patterns. Wordlikeness ratings were higher for nonwords containing high-probability constituents and were also higher for nonwords with fewer syllables. Differences in the processing of these same nonwords that partially reflected their perceived wordlikeness were also found in a recognition memory task. Nonwords with higher probability constituents yielded better recognition memory performance, suggesting that participants were able to use their knowledge of frequently occurring lexical patterns to improve recognition. These results suggest that lexical patterns provide the foundation of an emergent phonological competence used to process nonwords in both linguistic and metalinguistic tasks.},

In the present experiments we ask whether adult learners are also capable of such computations when the only available patterns occur in non-adjacent elements. In the first experiment, we present streams of speech in which precisely the same kinds of syllable regularities occur as in our previous studies, except that the patterned relations among syllables occur between non-adjacent syllables (with an intervening syllable that is unrelated). Under these circumstances we do not obtain our previous results: learners are quite poor at acquiring regular relations among non-adjacent syllables, even when the patterns are objectively quite simple. In subsequent experiments we show that learners are, in contrast, quite capable of acquiring patterned relations among non-adjacent segments-both non-adjacent consonants (with an intervening vocalic segment that is unrelated) and non-adjacent vowels (with an intervening consonantal segment that is unrelated). Finally, we discuss why human learners display these strong differences in learning differing types of non-adjacent regularities, and we conclude by suggesting that these contrasts in learnability may account for why human languages display non-adjacent regularities of one type much more widely than non-adjacent regularities of the other type. ?? 2003 Elsevier Inc.

	volume = {6},
	doi = {10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01762},
	abstract = {Music and language are human cognitive and neural functions that share many structural similarities. Past theories posit a sharing of neural resources between syntax processing in music and language (Patel, 2003), and a dynamic attention network that governs general temporal processing (Large and Jones, 1999). Both make predictions about music and language processing over time. Experiment 1 of this study investigates the relationship between rhythmic expectancy and musical and linguistic syntax in a reading time paradigm. Stimuli (adapted from Slevc et al., 2009) were sentences broken down into segments; each sentence segment was paired with a musical chord and presented at a fixed inter-onset interval. Linguistic syntax violations appeared in a garden-path design. During the critical region of the garden-path sentence, i.e., the particular segment in which the syntactic unexpectedness was processed, expectancy violations for language, music, and rhythm were each independently manipulated: musical expectation was manipulated by presenting out-of-key chords and rhythmic expectancy was manipulated by perturbing the fixed inter-onset interval such that the sentence segments and musical chords appeared either early or late. Reading times were recorded for each sentence segment and compared for linguistic, musical, and rhythmic expectancy. Results showed main effects of rhythmic expectancy and linguistic syntax expectancy on reading time. There was also an effect of rhythm on the interaction between musical and linguistic syntax: effects of violations in musical and linguistic syntax showed significant interaction only during rhythmically expected trials. To test the effects of our experimental design on rhythmic and linguistic expectancies, independently of musical syntax, Experiment 2 used the same experimental paradigm, but the musical factor was eliminated—linguistic stimuli were simply presented silently, and rhythmic expectancy was manipulated at the critical region. Experiment 2 replicated effects of rhythm and language, without an interaction. Together, results suggest that the interaction of music and language syntax processing depends on rhythmic expectancy, and support a merging of theories of music and language syntax processing with dynamic models of attentional entrainment.},

	abstract = {THE ORIGINS and adaptive significance of music, long an elusive target, are now active topics of empirical study, with many interesting developments over the past few years. This article reviews research in anthropology, eth- nomusicology, developmental and comparative psychol- ogy, neuropsychology, and neurophysiology that bears on questions concerning the origins and evolution of music. We focus on the hypothesis that music perception is constrained by innate, possibly human- and music- specific principles of organization, as these are candi- dates for evolutionary explanations. We begin by discussing the distinct roles of different fields of inquiry in constraining claims about innateness and adaptation, and then proceed to review the available evidence. Although research on many of these topics is still in its infancy, at present there is converging evidence that a few basic features of music (relative pitch, the importance of the octave, intervals with simple ratios, tonality, and per- haps elementary musical preferences) are determined in part by innate constraints. At present, it is unclear how many of these constraints are uniquely human and spe- cific to music. Many, however, are unlikely to be adapta- tions for music, but rather are probably side effects of more general-purpose mechanisms. We conclude by reiterating the significance of identifying processes that are innate, unique to humans, and specific to music, and highlight several possible directions for future research.},

As a result, the images we see accord with what the sources of the stimuli have typically turned out to be, rather than with the physical properties of the relevant objects. If vision does indeed depend upon this operational strategy to generate optimally useful perceptions of inevitably ambiguous stimuli, then the underlying neurobiological processes will eventually need to be understood within this conceptual framework.},

Unlike English, Russian makes an obligatory distinction between lighter blues ("goluboy") and darker blues ("siniy"). We investigated whether this linguistic difference leads to differences in color discrimination. We tested English and Russian speakers in a speeded color discrimination task using blue stimuli that spanned the siniy/goluboy border. We found that Russian speakers were faster to discriminate two colors when they fell into different linguistic categories in Russian (one siniy and the other goluboy) than when they were from the same linguistic category (both siniy or both goluboy). Moreover, this category advantage was eliminated by a verbal, but not a spatial, dual task. These effects were stronger for difficult discriminations (i.e., when the colors were perceptually close) than for easy discriminations (i.e., when the colors were further apart). English speakers tested on the identical stimuli did not show a category advantage in any of the conditions. These results demonstrate that (i) categories in language affect performance on simple perceptual color tasks and (ii) the effect of language is online (and can be disrupted by verbal interference).},

Brightness and lightness perception involve a number of mechanisms operating at different levels of visual processing. One mechanism is low-level, and processes spatial variations in brightness via multiscale filtering. It serves to achieve lightness constancy with respect to the ambient level of illumination. However, it comes at a cost: errors such as simultaneous brightness contrast. A second, mid-level mechanism aims to achieve lightness constancy with respect to spatially varying illumination such as shading, shadows, highlights and transparency. The cost in this case is an enhancement of errors in brightness judgement.},

Scientists discover qualitatively new forms of structure in observed data: For instance, Linnaeus recognized the hierarchical organization of biological species, and Mendeleev recognized the periodic structure of the chemical elements. Analogous insights play a pivotal role in cognitive development: Children discover that object category labels can be organized into hierarchies, friendship networks are organized into cliques, and comparative relations (e.g., "bigger than" or "better than") respect a transitive order. Standard algorithms, however, can only learn structures of a single form that must be specified in advance: For instance, algorithms for hierarchical clustering create tree structures, whereas algorithms for dimensionality-reduction create low-dimensional spaces. Here, we present a computational model that learns structures of many different forms and that discovers which form is best for a given dataset. The model makes probabilistic inferences over a space of graph grammars representing trees, linear orders, multidimensional spaces, rings, dominance hierarchies, cliques, and other forms and successfully discovers the underlying structure of a variety of physical, biological, and social domains. Our approach brings structure learning methods closer to human abilities and may lead to a deeper computational understanding of cognitive development.},

Posttonal music generally fails to meet these conditions and thus thwarts analysis in prolongational terms. To understand the middleground structure of posttonal music, we must employ instead an analytical model based on association, linking together distant tones by virtue of their shared register, timbre, metrical placement, or articulation.

It is unclear whether simple local features provide the stability necessary to subserve robust recognition of complex objects. In this article, we search the space of two-lobed differential operators for those that constitute a good representational code under recognition and discrimination criteria. We find that a novel operator, which we call the dissociated dipole, displays useful properties in this regard. We describe simple computational experiments to assess the merits of such dipoles relative to the more traditional local operators. The results suggest that nonlocal operators constitute a vocabulary that is stable across a range of image transformations.},

	abstract = {The spatial receptive fields of simple cells in mammalian striate cortex have been reasonably well described physiologically and can be characterized as being localized, oriented, and ban@ass, comparable with the basis functions of wavelet transforms. Previously, we have shown that these receptive field properties may be accounted for in terms of a strategy for producing a sparse distribution of output activity in response to natural images. Here, in addition to describing this work in a more expansive fashion, we examine the neurobiological implications of sparse coding. Of particular interest is the case when the code is overcomplete--i.e., when the number of code elements is greater than the effective dimensionality of the input space. Because the basis functions are non-orthogonal and not linearly independent of each other, sparsifying the code will recruit only those basis functions necessary for representing a given input, and so the input-output function will deviate from being purely linear. These deviations from linearity provide a potential explanation for the weak forms of non-linearity observed in the response properties of cortical simple cells, and they further make predictions about the expected interactions among units in response to naturalistic stimuli.},

	abstract = {Numerous generative approaches to explaining tonal structure and/or Schenker’s theories have been proposed since Babbitt noted a resemblance between Schenker’s analytical method and Chomskian generative grammars in 1965. One of the more challenging features of Schenker’s theory to replicate in a generative system is the interaction of counterpoint and hierarchy. Many theorists, such as Lerdahl and Jackendoff, skirt the problem by developing non-contrapuntal systems, meaning ones that do not allow for layers with conflicting hierarchical descriptions. This article tackles the counterpoint problem by first proposing a dynamic model for tonal hierarchy, which matches the usage of basic Schenkerian symbols (slurs and beams), and differs from the representational model used by Lerdahl and Jackendoff and others. I then summarize Schenker’s argument for a contrapuntal theory of tonal structure and show that this implies a relativity of contrapuntal voices to structural level which necessitates a theory of voice-leading transformation. This concept of voice-leading transformation marks a crucial turning point in Schenker’s analytical practice leading directly to his theory of levels, and is fundamental to understanding his late theory. The article also operationalizes the idea of voice-leading transformations within a generative system, and illustrates it with short analyses of themes from Bach’s Partitas and an extended analysis of the Menuetto from Beethoven’s Op. 21 Piano Sonata. In the latter analysis the concept of voice-leading transformation facilitates the discovery of an exceptional feature in the deep middleground of the piece.},

	abstract = {The lack of attention given to Schenkerian theory by empirical research in music is striking when compared to its status in music theory as a standard account of tonality. In this paper I advocate a different way of thinking of Schenkerian theory that can lead to empirically testable claims, and report on an experiment that shows how hypotheses derived from Schenker’s theories explain features of listener’s perception of key relationships. To be relevant to empirical research, Schenker’s theory must be treated as a collection of interrelated but independent theoretical claims rather than a comprehensive analytical method. These discrete theoretical claims can then lead to hypotheses that we can test through empirical methods. This makes it possible for Schenkerian theory improve our scientific understanding of how listeners understand tonal music. At the same time, it opens the possibility of challenging the usefulness of certain aspects of the theory. This paper exemplifies the empirical project with an experiment on the perception of key distance. The results show that two features of Schenkerian theory predict how listeners rate stimuli in terms of key distance. The first is the Schenkerian principle of “composing out” a harmony, and the second is the theory of “voice-leading prolongations.” In a regression analysis, both of these principles significantly improve upon a model of distance ratings based on change of scalar collection alone.},

	abstract = {Previous studies of auditory expectation have focused on the expectedness perceived by listeners retrospectively in response to events. In contrast, this research examines predictive uncertainty-a property of listeners' prospective state of expectation prior to the onset of an event. We examine the information-theoretic concept of Shannon entropy as a model of predictive uncertainty in music cognition. This is motivated by the Statistical Learning Hypothesis, which proposes that schematic expectations reflect probabilistic relationships between sensory events learned implicitly through exposure. Using probability estimates from an unsupervised, variable-order Markov model, 12 melodic contexts high in entropy and 12 melodic contexts low in entropy were selected from two musical repertoires differing in structural complexity (simple and complex). Musicians and non-musicians listened to the stimuli and provided explicit judgments of perceived uncertainty (explicit uncertainty). We also examined an indirect measure of uncertainty computed as the entropy of expectedness distributions obtained using a classical probe-tone paradigm where listeners rated the perceived expectedness of the final note in a melodic sequence (inferred uncertainty). Finally, we simulate listeners' perception of expectedness and uncertainty using computational models of auditory expectation. A detailed model comparison indicates which model parameters maximize fit to the data and how they compare to existing models in the literature. The results show that listeners experience greater uncertainty in high-entropy musical contexts than low-entropy contexts. This effect is particularly apparent for inferred uncertainty and is stronger in musicians than non-musicians. Consistent with the Statistical Learning Hypothesis, the results suggest that increased domain-relevant training is associated with an increasingly accurate cognitive model of probabilistic structure in music.},

Such a perspective has important implications for several topics of general interest besides evolutionary origins. For instance, neural overlap is an important premise for the possibility of music training to influence language acquisition and literacy. However, neural over- lap in processing music and speech does not entail sharing neural circuitries. Neural separability betweenmusic and speechmay occur in overlapping brain regions. In this paper, we review the evidence and outline the issues faced in interpreting such neural data, and argue that converging evidence from several methodologies is needed before neural overlap is taken as evidence of sharing.},

I show that very young children's language is consistent with a productive grammar rather than memorization of specific word combinations from caregivers' speech. Furthermore, I provide a statistically rigorous demonstration that the sign use of Nim Chimpsky, the chimpanzee who was taught American Sign Language, does not show the expected productivity of a rule-based grammar.

The results of a scaling study, in which subjects judged the similarities between pairs of tones presented in an explicitly tonal context, suggest that musical listeners extract a pattern of relationships among tones that is determined not only by pitch height and chroma, but also by membership in the major triad chord and the diatonic scale associated with the tonal system of the context. Multidimensional scaling of the similarity ratings gave a three-dimensional conical structure around which the tones were ordered according to pitch height. The major triad components formed a closely related cluster near the vertex of the cone; the remaining diatonic scale tones formed a less closely related subset farther from the vertex; and, the nondiatonic tones, still farther from the vertex, were widely dispersed. The results also suggest that, in the psychological representation, tones less closely related to the tonality are less stable than tones closely related to the tonality, and that the representation incorporates the tendency for unstable tones to move toward the more stable tones in time, reflecting the dynamic character of musical tones. In the similarity ratings of the scaling study, tones less related to the tonality were judged more similar to tones more related to the tonality than the reverse temporal order. Furthermore, in a delayed recognition task memory performance for nondiatonic tones was less accurate than for diatonic tones, and nondiatonic tones were more often confused with diatonic tones than diatonic tones were confused with nondiatonic tones. These results indicate the tonality-specific nature of the psychological representation and argue that the perception of music depends not only on psychoacoustic properties of the tones, but also on processes that relate the tones to one another through contact with a well-defined and complex psychological representation of musical pitch.},

Both these rule systems are similar in several respects. Thus, the marking of the hierarchical constituent structure seerns to be one of the important principles in composing simple melodies. The rule systems also show a number of similarities with the Chomsky \& Halle (1968) generative phonology of English. For instance, the proce- dures used for deriving a stress contour from a tree diagram are almost identical. Moreover, in sentences as in melodies this stress, or prominence contour is of decisive importance to the generation of the surface structure, such as meter, harmony, and sequences of pitches. It is believed that such parallels between language and music reflect characteristics of man s perceptual and cognitive capacities.},

We examined the impact of vocal timbre on children’s processing of melodies. In Study 1, 9- to 11-year-olds listened to 16 unfamiliar folk melodies (4 each of voice, piano, banjo, or marimba). They subsequently listened to the same melodies and 16 timbre-matched foils, and judged whether each melody was old or new. Vocal melodies were recognized better than instrumental melodies, which did not differ from one another, and the vocal advantage was consistent across age. In Study 2, 5- to 6-year-olds and 7- to 8-year-olds were tested with a simplified design that included only vocal and piano melodies. Both age groups successfully differentiated old from new melodies, but memory was more accurate for the older group. The older children recognized vocal melodies better than piano melodies, whereas the younger children tended to label vocal melodies as old whether they were old or new. The results provide the first evidence of differential processing of vocal and instrumental melodies in childhood.},

These assignments constitute so-called class data in that they possess no natural numerical properties and can be considered as arising from a classification process. A new approach for smoothing such class data using graph theoretic norm estimates is applied to the sequence of key assignments. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated by comparing it with judgments made by experts. Then, the problem is placed in the context of machine recognition of music patterns. We discuss a music pattern recognition system proposed by Coyle and Shmulevich (1998) that relies on robust determination of localized tonal context.

The structure and placement of a cadence can shape the emotional arc of a scene, accentuate narratival information, and manipulate generic expectations. Drawing from theories of film genre and cadential definition from Altman (1999) and Caplin (2002), I explore several cinematically significant cadential genres; harmonic routines arising through the convergence of independent musical phenomena that together project a punctuative function. Through processes of attribute substitution and subtraction, a cadential genre can adapt to shifting scoring practices and generic expectations. I showcase four such cadential genres. The mixed plagal cadence imports transcendent harmonic associations from the Romantic era. Phrasal mickey mousing arises through cadential synchronization, as shown in an analysis of Korngold’s Robin Hood. The subtonic half cadence is strongly linked with a specific film genre: the western. Through analysis of Jerome Moross’s subtonic-saturated scores and subsequent adapted and abstracted usages, I show the value of the generic approach to style-based analysis. Lastly, I inspect the chromatically modulating cadential resolution (CMCR): the strategy of initiating a diatonic cadence in one key only for the dominant to discharge onto the tonic of a chromatically related key. Through a variety of intrinsic and contextual traits describable by linear, transformational, and cognitive models, I explain the strong association of CMCRs with cinematic evocations of wonderment. This is illustrated through a case study of Williams’s Jurassic Park.},

We set out a formal framework for analyzing cultural transmission, which allows us to investigate how innate learning biases are related to universal properties of language. We show that cultural transmission can magnify weak biases into strong linguistic universals, undermining one of the arguments for strong innate constraints on language learning. As a consequence, the strength of innate biases can be shielded from natural selection, allowing these genes to drift. Furthermore, even when there is no natural selection, cultural transmission can produce apparent adaptations. Cultural transmission thus provides an alternative to traditional nativist and adaptationist explanations for the properties of human languages.},

	abstract = {Transformational music theory mainly deals with group and group actions on sets, which are usually constituted by chords. For example, neo-Riemannian theory uses the dihedral group D24 to study transformations between major and minor triads, the building blocks of classical and romantic harmony. Since the developments of neo-Riemannian theory, many developments and generalizations have been proposed, based on other sets of chords, other groups, etc. However music theory also face problems for example when defining transformations between chords of different cardinalities, or for transformations that are not necessarily invertible. This paper introduces a categorical construction of musical transformations based on category extensions using groupoids. This can be seen as a generalization of a previous work which aimed at building generalized neo-Riemannian groups of transformations based on group extensions. The categorical extension construction allows the definition of partial transformations between different set-classes. Moreover, it can be shown that the typical wreath products groups of transformations can be recovered from the category extensions by "packaging" operators and considering their composition.},

As expected, subjects had difficulty in recreating the original piece. However, their answers revealed some interesting patterns, including (1) Some sensitivity to the overall structure of A–B–A’ around the non-stable B section; (2) Non-trivial sensitivity to overall “directionality” as shown by a new type of analysis (“distance score”); (3) Correct grouping and placement of developmental sections possibly related to listener’s sensitivity to musical tension; and (4) Sensitivity to opening and closing gestures, thematic similarity, and surface cues. In the current paper we further validate these findings by comparing the results obtained from a new group of participants who performed an 8-segment puzzle task of Haydn’s E minor piano sonata Hob. VXI-34/I. The similarity of our results to those obtained with the Mozart sonata validates our methods and points to the robustness of our findings, despite the differences in the music contexts (composer and key), and despite some methodological caveats.},

The proposed methodology involves free, associative responses as well as responses on semantic variables addressing the imagery. After deriving potential topical structures for a given musical domain from the quantitative results, the structures are substantiated by using them to guide a rule-based, qualitative analysis of the free responses. The approach allows a view to the topical organization of a musical domain in which the identity of each musical topos is fixed in extrinsic terms, by a set of semantic fields that is unique to the topos in question. An application of the approach to contemporary ‘‘motivational’’ production music yields an organiza- tion of such semantic fields into three topical cate- gories—INTIMACY, POTENCY,and SPEED.},

	abstract = {The most common method for measuring melodic expectancy is the “probe-tone” design, which relies on a retrospective report of expectancy. Here a direct measure of expectancy is introduced, one that uses a speeded, serial categorization task. An analysis of the reaction time data showed that “Implication-Realization” contour models of melodic expectancy provide a good fit. Further analysis suggests that some assumptions of these contour models may not be valid. The traditional “key profile” model of tonality was not found to contribute significantly to the model. Following Krumhansl’s (1990) argument that tonality is learned from the statistical distribution of scale degrees, a tonality model based on the actual probability of scale degrees did significantly improve the fit of the model. It is proposed that the probe-tone method for measuring key profiles encourages listeners to treat the probe tone as being in phrase-final position. Indeed, the key profile was found to be much more similar to the distribution of phrase-final notes than to the distribution of all melodic notes. A second experiment measured reaction times to notes that subjects expected to be phrase-final. In this experiment the key profile contributed significantly to the fit of the model. It is concluded that the probe-tone design creates a task demand to hear the tone as a phrase-final note, and the key profile reflects a learned sensitivity to the distribution of notes at ends of melodies. The “key profile” produced by the new reaction-time design is apparently related to the general distribution of notes in melodies. The results of this study indicate that the relationship between melodic structure and melodic expectation is more straightforward than has been previously demonstrated. Melodic expectation appears to be related directly to the structure and distribution of events in the music.},

	abstract = {Previous discussions of musical pattern haveunderlined difficulties in seeking pattern as asequence of pitches, or of intervals or of other localand atomic features. This paper describes a manner ofrepresenting melodies through a hierarchical structureof elaboration, derived from concepts common in musictheory (in particular, the concept of reduction foundin the work of Schenker and of Lerdahl \& Jackendoff).The fundamental structure is a planar directed acyclicgraph, each node of which represents a musical note(not necessarily as it is present in the actualmelody) and an elaboration which generates that noteon the basis of two parents. These graph structurescan be converted to trees, aiding processing andcomparison, in two ways. Firstly, any graph can betransformed into a set of binary trees in which eachnode represents an interval between two notes and anelaboration of that interval. Secondly, in the planargraph, the link of a node to one of its parents oftenprovides no useful information and can be disregarded,resulting in a reduction of the graph tending towardsa set of trees. From this arises a new approach to thequestion of melodic segmentation. Examples of melodicfragments represented in this manner demonstrate howthe representation makes explicit similarities betweenfragments which would not be found by an approachusing sequences of features.},

	abstract = {Perception of temporal patterns is fundamental to normal hearing, speech, motor control, and music. Certain types of pattern understanding are unique to humans, such as musical rhythm. Although human responses to musical rhythm are universal, there is much we do not understand about how rhythm is processed in the brain. Here, I consider findings from research into basic timing mechanisms and models through to the neuroscience of rhythm and meter. A network of neural areas, including motor regions, is regularly implicated in basic timing as well as processing of musical rhythm. However, fractionating the specific roles of individual areas in this network has remained a challenge. Distinctions in activity patterns appear between "automatic" and "cognitively controlled" timing processes, but the perception of musical rhythm requires features of both automatic and controlled processes. In addition, many experimental manipulations rely on participants directing their attention toward or away from certain stimulus features, and measuring corresponding differences in neural activity. Many temporal features, however, are implicitly processed whether attended to or not, making it difficult to create controlled baseline conditions for experimental comparisons. The variety of stimuli, paradigms, and definitions can further complicate comparisons across domains or methodologies. Despite these challenges, the high level of interest and multitude of methodological approaches from different cognitive domains (including music, language, and motor learning) have yielded new insights and hold promise for future progress.},

It analyses aspects of tonal harmony and harmonic patterns based on a statistical, computational corpus analysis of Bach’s chorales. This is carried out using a novel heuristic method of segmentation developed specifically for that purpose. Analyses of distributions of single pc sets, chord classes and pc set transitions reveal very different structural patterns in both modes, many, but not all of which accord with standard music theory. In addition, most frequent chord transitions are found to exhibit a large degree of asymmetry, or, directedness, in way that for two pc sets A,B the transition frequencies f(A→B) and f(B→A) may differ to a large extent. Distributions of unigrams and bigrams are found to follow a Zipf distribution, i.e. decay in frequency roughly according to 1/x2 which implies that the majority of the musical structure is governed by a few frequent elements. The findings provide evidence for an underlying harmonic syntax which results in distinct statistical patterns. A subsequent respective antecedent and consequent hierarchical cluster analysis of pc sets based on patterns finds that this information suffices to group chords into meaningful functional groups solely on intrinsic statistical grounds without regard to pitch content.},

Th\& separation of chords unique to the keys and the multiple functions of chords shared by the different keys were simultaneously represented.

Uniform patterns provide a way of precisely and quantitatively comparing different kinds of chromatic patterns to diatonic ones by drawing upon the kind of robust, continuous metrics associated with voice-leading spaces. The possibility of deriving chromatic and diatonic logics from common principles suggests a new perspective on the “integration” problem of nineteenth-century harmony—the question of whether chromaticism represents a radical break or an evolution from conventional tonal harmony. The theory of uniform patterns and generic intervals is applied in analysis of the first movement of Schubert's String Quartet No. 15 and other passages from Schubert and Liszt.},

First, a brief comparison of music and language leads to discussion of design features of music, suggesting a deep connection between the biology of music and language. I then selectively review data on animal "music." Examining sound production in animals, we find examples of repeated convergent evolution or analogy (the evolution of vocal learning of complex songs in birds, whales, and seals). A fascinating but overlooked potential homology to instrumental music is provided by manual percussion in African apes. Such comparative behavioral data, combined with neuroscientific and developmental data, provide an important starting point for any hypothesis about how or why human music evolved. Regarding these functional and phylogenetic questions, I discuss some previously proposed functions of music, including Pinker's "cheesecake" hypothesis; Darwin's and others' sexual selection model; Dunbar's group "grooming" hypothesis; and Trehub's caregiving model. I conclude that only the last hypothesis receives strong support from currently available data. I end with a brief synopsis of Darwin's model of a songlike musical "protolanguage," concluding that Darwin's model is consistent with much of the available evidence concerning the evolution of both music and language. There is a rich future for empirical investigations of the evolution of music, both in investigations of individual differences among humans, and in interspecific investigations of musical abilities in other animals, especially those of our ape cousins, about which we know little.},

Over the last twenty years, the field of implicit learning has come to embody ongoing questioning about three fundamental issues in the cognitive sciences: (1) consciousness (how one should conceptualize and measure the relationships between conscious and unconscious cognition); (2) mental representation (in particular, the complex issue of abstraction); and (3) modularity and the architecture of the cognitive system (whether one should think of implicit and explicit learning as being subtended by separable systems of the brain or not). Computational modeling plays a central role in addressing these issues. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2009 APA, all rights reserved)},

Furthermore, the particular subclass of such processes that producen-order statistical approximations to English do not come closer, with increasingn, to matching the output of an English grammar. We formalize-the notions of "phrase structure" and show that this gives us a method for describing language which is essentially more powerful, though still representable as a rather elementary type of finite-state process. Nevertheless, it is successful only when limited to a small subset of simple sentences. We study the formal properties of a set of grammatical transformations that carry sentences with phrase structure into new sentences with derived phrase structure, showing that transformational grammars are processes of the same elementary type as phrase-structure grammars; that the grammar of English is materially simplified if phrase structure description is limited to a kernel of simple sentences from which all other sentences are constructed by repeated transformations; and that this view of linguistic structure gives a certain insight into the use and understanding of language.},

Thus we can relate the two kinds of informa- tion and predict perception data from production data. In this approach, the contrast between rhythm percep- tion and production data, taken from different studies in the literature, was shown almost to disappear, assem- bling independent prior probabilities from counts of patterns in corpora of musical scores, or from a theoret- ical measure of rhythmic complexity. The success of this Bayesian formalization may be interpreted as an optimal adaptation of our perceptual system to the environment in which the produced rhythms occur.},

Simple meters predominate in North American music, but complex meters are common in many other musical cultures. In Experiment 1, North American adults rated structure-violating alterations as less similar to the original version than structure-preserving alterations for simple-meter patterns but not for complex-meter patterns. In Experiment 2, adults of Bulgarian or Macedonian origin provided differential ratings to structure-violating and structure-preserving alterations in complex- as well as simple-meter contexts. In Experiment 3, 6-month-old infants responded differentially to structure-violating and structure-preserving alterations in both metrical contexts. These findings imply that the metrical biases of North American adults reflect enculturation processes rather than processing predispositions for simple meters.},

	abstract = {In this response to Pinker and Jackendoff's critique, we extend our previous framework for discussion of language evolution, clarifying certain distinctions and elaborating on a number of points. In the first half of the paper, we reiterate that profitable research into the biology and evolution of language requires fractionation of "language" into component mechanisms and interfaces, a non-trivial endeavor whose results are unlikely to map onto traditional disciplinary boundaries. Our terminological distinction between FLN and FLB is intended to help clarify misunderstandings and aid interdisciplinary rapprochement. By blurring this distinction, Pinker and Jackendoff mischaracterize our hypothesis 3 which concerns only FLN, not "language" as a whole. Many of their arguments and examples are thus irrelevant to this hypothesis. Their critique of the minimalist program is for the most part equally irrelevant, because very few of the arguments in our original paper were tied to this program; in an online appendix we detail the deep inaccuracies in their characterization of this program. Concerning evolution, we believe that Pinker and Jackendoff's emphasis on the past adaptive history of the language faculty is misplaced. Such questions are unlikely to be resolved empirically due to a lack of relevant data, and invite speculation rather than research. Preoccupation with the issue has retarded progress in the field by diverting research away from empirical questions, many of which can be addressed with comparative data. Moreover, offering an adaptive hypothesis as an alternative to our hypothesis concerning mechanisms is a logical error, as questions of function are independent of those concerning mechanism. The second half of our paper consists of a detailed response to the specific data discussed by Pinker and Jackendoff. Although many of their examples are irrelevant to our original paper and arguments, we find several areas of substantive disagreement that could be resolved by future empirical research. We conclude that progress in understanding the evolution of language will require much more empirical research, grounded in modern comparative biology, more interdisciplinary collaboration, and much less of the adaptive storytelling and phylogenetic speculation that has traditionally characterized the field.},

This implicitly acquired tonal knowledge allows nonmusician listeners to perceive relationships among musical events and to develop expectations for future events that then influence the processing of these events. The musical priming paradigm is one method of the indirect investigation of listeners' tonal knowledge. It investigates the influence of a preceding context (with its musical structures and relationships) on the processing of a musical target event, without asking participants for direct evaluations. Behavioral priming data have provided evidence for facilitated processing of musically related events in comparison to unrelated and less-related events. The sensitivity of implicit investigations is further shown by I.R., a patient with severe amusia, showing spared implicit knowledge of music. Finally, the priming paradigm allows us to investigate the neural correlates of musical structure processing. Two fMRI studies reported the implication of inferior frontal regions in musical priming, contrasting related and unrelated events, as well as finer structural manipulations contrasting in-key events.},

In the present experiment, such chords elicited an early effect, taken as the magnetic equivalent of the ERAN (termed mERAN). The source of mERAN activity was localized in Broca's area and its right-hemisphere homologue, areas involved in syntactic analysis during auditory language comprehension. We find that these areas are also responsible for an analysis of incoming harmonic sequences, indicating that these regions process syntactic information that is less language-specific than previously believed.},

A separate principal-components analysis of the predictors of the revised model yielded a two-factor solution that did not compromise the revised model's predictive power. Consequently, an even simpler model of melodic expectancy was derived.

Experiment 2 was an attempt to identify the point in chord sequences that is responsible for the occurrence of the priming effect. In Experiment 3, Bigand and Pineau's findings were extended to wider harmonic contexts (i.e., defined at three hierarchical levels), and new evidence was provided that chord processing also depends on the temporal organization of the musical sequence. Neural net simulations globally support J. J. Bharucha's (1987, 1994) view that priming effects result from activations spreading via a schematic knowledge of Western harmony.},

	abstract = {Humans possess an ability to perceive and synchronize movements to the beat in music ('beat perception and synchronization'), and recent neuroscientific data have offered new insights into this beat-finding capacity at multiple neural levels. Here, we review and compare behavioural and neural data on temporal and sequential processing during beat perception and entrainment tasks in macaques (including direct neural recording and local field potential (LFP)) and humans (including fMRI, EEG and MEG). These abilities rest upon a distributed set of circuits that include the motor cortico-basal-ganglia-thalamo-cortical (mCBGT) circuit, where the supplementary motor cortex (SMA) and the putamen are critical cortical and subcortical nodes, respectively. In addition, a cortical loop between motor and auditory areas, connected through delta and beta oscillatory activity, is deeply involved in these behaviours, with motor regions providing the predictive timing needed for the perception of, and entrainment to, musical rhythms. The neural discharge rate and the LFP oscillatory activity in the gamma- and beta-bands in the putamen and SMA of monkeys are tuned to the duration of intervals produced during a beat synchronization-continuation task (SCT). Hence, the tempo during beat synchronization is represented by different interval-tuned cells that are activated depending on the produced interval. In addition, cells in these areas are tuned to the serial-order elements of the SCT. Thus, the underpinnings of beat synchronization are intrinsically linked to the dynamics of cell populations tuned for duration and serial order throughout the mCBGT. We suggest that a cross-species comparison of behaviours and the neural circuits supporting them sets the stage for a new generation of neurally grounded computational models for beat perception and synchronization.},

These structures enable a durational realization. Phonological stress also helps assign the poem's normative melodic contour. Finally, the similarities and differences in sound repetition are given hierarchical structure by means of musical prolongational theory. These formal parallels suggest a corresponding realization in brain localization and function. Evidence from the neuropsychological literature is cited in support of this view. The picture emerges that grouping, meter, duration, contour, and timbral similarity are mind/brain systems shared by music and language, whereas linguistic syntax and semantics and musical pitch relations are systems not shared by the two domains.},

Recent studies have highlighted that the behavioural relevance of stimuli to animals and the relation of experimental procedures to their natural behaviour can have a large impact on the type of results that can be obtained for a given species. Through reviewing laboratory findings on animal auditory perception and behaviour, as well as relevant findings on natural behaviour, we provide evidence that both traditional laboratory studies and studies relating to natural behaviour are needed to answer the problem of musicality. Traditional laboratory studies use synthetic stimuli that provide more control than more naturalistic studies, and are in many ways suitable to test the perceptual abilities of animals. However, naturalistic studies are essential to inform us as to what might constitute relevant stimuli and parameters to test with laboratory studies, or why we may or may not expect certain stimulus manipulations to be relevant. These two approaches are both vital in the comparative study of musicality.},

	abstract = {Prediction or expectancy is thought to play an important role in both music and language processing. However, prediction is currently studied independently in the two domains, limiting research on relations between predictive mechanisms in music and language. One limitation is a difference in how expectancy is quantified. In language, expectancy is typically measured using the cloze probability task, in which listeners are asked to complete a sentence fragment with the first word that comes to mind. In contrast, previous production-based studies of melodic expectancy have asked participants to sing continuations following only one to two notes. We have developed a melodic cloze probability task in which listeners are presented with the beginning of a novel tonal melody (5–9 notes) and are asked to sing the note they expect to come next. Half of the melodies had an underlying harmonic structure designed to constrain expectations for the next note, based on an implied authentic cadence (AC) within themelody. Each such ‘authentic cadence’ melody was matched to a ‘non-cadential’ (NC) melody matched in terms of length, rhythmand melodic contour, but differing in implied harmonic structure. Participants showed much greater consistency in the notes sung following AC vs. NC melodies on average. However, significant variation in degree of consistency was observed within both AC and NCmelodies. Analysis of individual melodies suggests that pitch prediction in tonal melodies depends on the interplay of local factors just prior to the target note (e.g., local pitch interval patterns) and larger-scale structural relationships (e.g., melodic patterns and implied harmonic structure). We illustrate how the melodic clozemethod can be used to test a computational model ofmelodic expectation. Future uses for the method include exploring the interplay of different factors shaping melodic expectation, and designing experiments that compare the cognitive mechanisms of prediction in music and language.},

This entails analysis of 'creativity', an imprecise construct: comparable properties in non-humans differ in magnitude and teleology from generally agreed human creativity. We then address two apparent problems: (i) the difference between merely novel productions and 'creative' ones; (ii) the emergence of creative behaviour in spite of high cost: does it fit the idea that females choose a male who succeeds in spite of a handicap (costly ornament); or that creative males capable of producing a large and complex song repertoire grew up under favourable conditions; or a demonstration of generally beneficial heightened reasoning capacity; or an opportunity to continually reinforce social bonding through changing communication tropes; or something else? We illustrate and support our argument by reference to whale and bird song; these independently evolved biological signal mechanisms objectively share surface properties with human behaviours generally called 'creative'. Studying them may elucidate mechanisms underlying human creativity; we outline a research programme to do so.},

Using a database of Bachs chorales, the model induces keys and key profiles for given harmonic contexts and accounts for related music theoretical concepts of harmonic ambiguity and revision. Some common results from music analytical practice can be accounted for with the model. The sliding window key induction gives evidence of cases in which key is established or modulation is recognised even though neither dominant nor leading tone was involved. This may give rise to a more flexible, probabilistic interpretation of key which would encompass ambiguity and under-determination. In addition, a novel method of harmonically adequate segmen-tation is presented.1},

Empiricism is not opposed to theoretical systematization, but it can rather be seen as an inclination towards theories which are capable of empirical adequacy. The empirical, or observational component of research may nevertheless be understood in slightly different ways, depending on whether there is only one observer (or many), and depending on whether the observations are treated as falling within a single category (or not). It is argued that either the observer or the observational category has to be assumed constant in order that the research may be called truly empirical. It is also argued that such decisions concerning empirical methodology naturally correspond to distinctions between subdisciplines of empirical musicology, each of them associated with different research interests.

	abstract = {The sound of music may arouse profound emotions in listeners. But such experiences seem to involve a 'paradox', namely that music - an abstract form of art, which appears removed from our concerns in everyday life - can arouse emotions - biologically evolved reactions related to human survival. How are these (seemingly) non-commensurable phenomena linked together? Key is to understand the processes through which sounds are imbued with meaning. It can be argued that the survival of our ancient ancestors depended on their ability to detect patterns in sounds, derive meaning from them, and adjust their behavior accordingly. Such an ecological perspective on sound and emotion forms the basis of a recent multi-level framework that aims to explain emotional responses to music in terms of a large set of psychological mechanisms. The goal of this review is to offer an updated and expanded version of the framework that can explain both 'everyday emotions' and 'aesthetic emotions'. The revised framework - referred to as BRECVEMA - includes eight mechanisms: Brain Stem Reflex, Rhythmic Entrainment, Evaluative Conditioning, Contagion, Visual Imagery, Episodic Memory, Musical Expectancy, and Aesthetic Judgment. In this review, it is argued that all of the above mechanisms may be directed at information that occurs in a 'musical event' (i.e., a specific constellation of music, listener, and context). Of particular significance is the addition of a mechanism corresponding to aesthetic judgments of the music, to better account for typical 'appreciation emotions' such as admiration and awe. Relationships between aesthetic judgments and other mechanisms are reviewed based on the revised framework. It is suggested that the framework may contribute to a long-needed reconciliation between previous approaches that have conceptualized music listeners' responses in terms of either 'everyday emotions' or 'aesthetic emotions'. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {This paper provides a theoretical framework upon which to build a system for chordal analysis of music. We establish that, in the worst case, the partitioning and labeling of harmonies in tonal music is O(2N), where N is number of notes in a piece of music. We show that, when segments of the music can be analyzed locally, and a segment scoring metric can be found that is both additive and transitive, the problem becomes O(N2). Under these constraints, the problem is cast as finding the best path through a single- source directed acyclic graph, which can be solved in O(E + V) time. This translates to a worst-case time complexity of O(N2) for our problem. We then show that the results of the O(N2) search can be closely approximated through the use of a heuristic that allows O(N) time search. The results of the heuristic search are then compared to exhaustive graph search and the results of analyses by existing systems by Winograd (Winograd 1968), Maxwell (Maxwell 1992), and Temperley and Sleator (Temperley and Sleator 1999).},

Several changes are proposed. First, the formula used for the matching process is somewhat simplified. Second, alternative values are proposed for the key profiles themselves. Third, rather than summing the durations of all events of each pitch class, the revised model divides the piece into short segments and labels each pitch class as present or absent in each segment. Fourth, a mechanism for modulation is proposed; a penalty is imposed for changing key from one segment to the next. An implementation of this model was subjected to two tests. First, the model was tested on the fugue subjects from Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier; the model's performance on this corpus is compared with the performances of other models. Second, the model was tested on a corpus of excerpts from the Kostka and Payne harmony textbook (as analyzed by Kostka). Several problems with the modified algorithm are discussed, concerning the rate of modulation, the role of harmony in key finding, and the role of pitch "spellings." The model is also compared with Huron and Parncutt's exponential decay model. The tests presented here suggest that the key-profile model, with the modifications proposed, can provide a highly successful approach to key finding.},

Taking Markov models as a case in point, this paper illustrates in detail core notions of representation, model structure, parameter estimation, context-dependency, sparsity and overfitting, as well as the distinction between different levels of expectancy (short-term vs. long-term and knowledge-driven vs. data-driven vs. veridical) that interact in the context of musical listening. The final part compares local and hierarchical accounts of music and analyzes phenomena of nested implication-realization patterns, revision, and garden-path effects.},

The results show that segmentation is better after exposure to sung compared to spoken material and moreover, that linguistic structure is better learned than the musical structure when using sung material. In addition, musical expertise facilitates the learning of both linguistic and musical structures.

With this grammar an automatic harmonic analysis of a sequence of symbolic chord labels is obtained in the form of a parse tree. The harmonic similarity is determined by finding and examining the largest labeled common embeddable subtree (LLCES) of two parse trees. For the calculation of the LLCES a new O(min(n,m)nm) time algorithm is presented, where n and m are the sizes of the trees. For the analysis of the LLCES we propose six distance measures that exploit several structural characteristics of the Combined LLCES. We demonstrate in a retrieval experiment that at least one of these new methods significantly outperforms a baseline string matching approach and thereby show that using additional musical knowledge from music cognitive and music theoretic models actually helps improving retrieval performance.},

	abstract = {Research indicates that people value music primarily because of the emotions it evokes. Yet, the notion of musical emotions remains controversial, and researchers have so far been unable to offer a satisfactory account of such emotions. We argue that the study of musical emotions has suffered from a neglect of underlying mechanisms. Specifically, researchers have studied musical emotions without regard to how they were evoked, or have assumed that the emotions must be based on the "default" mechanism for emotion induction, a cognitive appraisal. Here, we present a novel theoretical framework featuring six additional mechanisms through which music listening may induce emotions: (1) brain stem reflexes, (2) evaluative conditioning, (3) emotional contagion, (4) visual imagery, (5) episodic memory, and (6) musical expectancy. We propose that these mechanisms differ regarding such characteristics as their information focus, ontogenetic development, key brain regions, cultural impact, induction speed, degree of volitional influence, modularity, and dependence on musical structure. By synthesizing theory and findings from different domains, we are able to provide the first set of hypotheses that can help researchers to distinguish among the mechanisms. We show that failure to control for the underlying mechanism may lead to inconsistent or non-interpretable findings. Thus, we argue that the new framework may guide future research and help to resolve previous disagreements in the field. We conclude that music evokes emotions through mechanisms that are not unique to music, and that the study of musical emotions could benefit the emotion field as a whole by providing novel paradigms for emotion induction.},

Section 1 introduces the problem of "transportability," noting that it is sometimes impossible to say whether two different directions - located at two different points in a geometrical space - are "the same" or not. Relevant examples include the surface of the earth and the geometrical spaces representing n-note chords. Section 2 argues the we should not require that every interval be defined at every point in a space, since some musical spaces have natural boundaries. It also notes that there are spaces, including the familiar pitch class circle, in which there are multiple paths between any two points. This leads to the suggestion that we might sometimes want to replace traditional pitch-class invervals with paths in pitch-class space, a more fine-grained alternative that specifies how one pitch class moves to another. Section 3 argues that group theory alone cannot represent the intuition that intervals have quantifiable sizes, proposing an extension to Lewin's formalism that accomplishes this goal. Finally, Section 4 considers the analytical implications of the preceding points, paying particular attention to questions about voice leading.},

original pitch classes to be restated—a formal property that we hypothesize leads to perceptual grouping

dominant harmonies, particularly the dominant seventh. The results of the analyses and the intervalcycle proximityhypothesis are discussed with respect to Browne’s (1981) rare-interval hypothesisand

In language, the statistical regularity known as Zipf’s law — which concerns the frequency of usage of different words — has been quantitatively related to the process of text generation. The connection is established by Simon’s model, on the basis of a few assumptions regarding the accompanying creation of context. This model captures the essential mechanism of repetition of perceptual elements, which underlies the construction of a structured, comprehensible message. Here, it is shown that the statistics of note usage in musical compositions are compatible with the predictions of Simon’s model. This result, which gives objective support to the conceptual likeness of context in language and music, is obtained through automatic analysis of the digital versions of several compositions. As a by-product, a quantitative measure of context definiteness is introduced, and used to compare tonal and atonal works.},

	abstract = {A system for automatically deriving a Schenkerian reduction of an extract of tonal music is described. Schenkerian theory is formalised in a quasi-grammatical manner, expressing a reduction as a binary-tree structure. Computer software which operates in the manner of a chart parser using this grammar has been implemented, capable of deriving a matrix of reduction possibilities, in polynomial time, from a representation of the score. A full reduction of the extract can be discovered by selecting a tree from this matrix. The number of possible valid reductions for even short extracts is found to be extremely large, so criteria are required to distinguish good reductions from bad ones. To find such criteria, themes from five Mozart piano sonatas are analysed and samples of 'good' reductions (defined by reference to pre-existing analyses of these themes) are compared with randomly sampled reductions. Nine criteria are thereby derived, which can be applied in the process of parsing and selecting a reduction. The results are promising, but the process is still too computationally expensive--only extracts of a few bars in length can be reduced--and more extensive testing is required before the system can be properly claimed to perform automatic Schenkerian analysis.},

However, how humans acquire knowledge of and develop preferences for music remains unknown.The present study shows that humans rapidly develop knowledge and preferences when given limited exposure to a new musical system.Using a non- traditional, unfamiliar musical scale (Bohlen-Pierce scale), we created finite-state musical grammars from which we composed sets of melodies.After 25-30 min of passive exposure to the melodies, participants showed extensive learning as characterized by recognition, gen- eralization, and sensitivity to the event frequencies in their given grammar, as well as increased preference for repeated melodies in the new musical system. Results provide evidence that a domain-general statistical learn- ing mechanism may account for much of the human appreciation for music.},

	abstract = {Of all concepts that might be borrowed from linguistics for musical discourse, syntax has enjoyed the. most prominence in recent years, particularly in theoretical writing. Indeed, while in general the anal- ogy of music and language has taken a beating, the unabashed use of "syntax" as a technical term has only increased steadily. 1 First put to extensive use by Hugo Riemann in his book Musikalische Syntaxis (1877) in an attempt to describe chord progression in western music, the term now embraces almost any kind of abstracted relationship among musical phenomena in a composition. "Relationship" can be virtually synonymous with "structure," and since structure has been the operative paradigm par excellence in music theory for some decades, the attraction of the concept of syntax, with its connotations of structures developed in real time, is easy to understand.2 In fact, when Chomsky's generative grammar seemed to have elevated exactly that part of linguistic study into a science in the late 1950s, just at the time when both high logical positivism and serial composition were reaching their high-water marks, the adoption of "syntax" by musicians was probably inevitable. But when we adopt "musical syn- tax," are we getting anything more than a modish synonym for "musi- cal structure"? What should the analogy really import from languag},

The analysis shows that rappers possess detailed implicit knowledge about speech sounds that is largely irrelevant to the sound pattern of their particular language, but has been argued to play a role in constraining possible sound systems across all human languages. We argue that rhyme data are related to phonological typology because many phonological patterns involve the neutralization of contrasts in contexts where they are less perceptible, and rhyme involves implicit judgments of perceptual similarity between sounds. The general finding is that sounds are more likely to mismatch in a rhyme in those contexts where the contrast between the sounds is more likely to neutralize cross-linguistically, even though the contrasts studied here do not neutralize in these contexts in English. The results contribute to the evidence for detailed implicit phonetic knowledge and bear on the issue of synchronic explanation in linguistic theory.},

	abstract = {It is often claimed that music and language share a process of hierarchical structure building, a mental “syntax”. Although several lines of research point to commonalities, and possibly a shared syntactic component, differences between “language syntax” and “music syntax” can also be found at several levels: conveyed meaning, and the atoms of combination, for example. To bring music and language closer to one another, some researchers have suggested a comparison between music and phonology (‘phonological syntax’), but here too, one quickly arrives at a situation of intriguing similarities and obvious differences. In this paper we suggest that a fruitful comparison between the two domains could benefit from taking the grammar of action into account. In particular, we suggest that what is called “syntax” can be investigated in terms of goal of action, action planning, motor control, and sensory-motor integration. At this level of comparison, we suggest that some of the differences between language and music could be explained in terms of different goals reflected in the hierarchical structures of action planning: the hierarchical structures of music arise to achieve goals with a strong relation to the affective-gestural system encoding tension-relaxation patterns as well as socio-intentional system, whereas hierarchical structures in language are embedded in a conceptual system that gives rise to compositional meaning. Similarities between music and language are most clear in the way several hierarchical plans for executing action are processed in time and sequentially integrated to achieve various goals.},

These principles are treated in a manner akin to axioms in a formal system from which the traditional rules of voice-leading are derived. Nontraditional rules aris- ing from the derivation are shown to predict formerly unnoticed aspects of voice-leading practice. In addition to the core perceptual principles, several auxiliary principles are described. These auxiliary principles are occasionally linked to voice-leading practice and may be regarded as com- positional “options” that shape the music-making in perceptually unique ways. It is suggested that these auxiliary principles distinguish different types of part writing, such as polyphony, homophony, and close har- mony. A theory is proposed to account for the aesthetic origin of voice- leading practices.},

An explanation is offered for these phenomena, using the theory of uniform infor- mation density. This theory states that communication is optimal when the density of information (the nega- tive log of probability) maintains a consistent, moderate level. The repetition of a pattern of intervals is (in some circumstances, at least) highly probable; in some cases, the information density of such repetitions may be undesirably low. The composer can balance this low information by injecting a high-information (i.e., low- probability) element into the repetition such as a large interval or a chromatic note. A perceptual model is proposed, showing how the probabilities of intervals, scale degrees, and repetition might be calculated and combined.},

For example, in a statistical study by Rohrmeier of the frequencies of diatonic chord progressions in Bach chorales, chord II was five times more likely to follow chord IV than to precede it; chord I followed chord V twice as often as preceding it, and so on. This research draws together two existing lines of research with the aim of showing how local and possibly global dependency relationships specified in Rohrmeier's generative grammar may be linked to and supported by chord attraction levels as specified in Woolhouse's pitch attraction model. It is argued that, to a significant degree, the transitional regularities of chords in tonal music can be explained and understood in terms of generative rules of tonal harmony and pitch attraction. Empirical evidence is provided which supports the notion that chord transition asymmetries in Bach chorales are linked to chord attraction, mediated by an underlying syntactic process.},

Here, we report a crosscultural study with participants from a native African population (Mafa) and Western participants, with both groups being naive to the music of the other respective culture. Experiment 1 investigated the ability to recognize three basic emotions (happy, sad, scared/fearful) expressed in Western music. Results show that the Mafas recognized happy, sad, and scared/fearful Western music excerpts above chance, indicating that the expression of these basic emotions in Western music can be recognized universally. Experiment 2 examined how a spectral manipulation of original, naturalistic music affects the perceived pleasantness of music in Western as well as in Mafa listeners. The spectral manipulation modified, among other factors, the sensory dissonance of the music. The data show that both groups preferred original Western music and also original Mafa music over their spectrally manipulated versions. It is likely that the sensory dissonance produced by the spectral manipulation was at least partly responsible for this effect, suggesting that consonance and permanent sensory dissonance universally influence the perceived pleasantness of music. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

To know whether a non-significant result counts against a theory, or if it just indicates data insensitivity, researchers must use one of: power, intervals (such as confidence or credibility intervals), or else an indicator of the relative evidence for one theory over another, such as a Bayes factor. I argue Bayes factors allow theory to be linked to data in a way that overcomes the weaknesses of the other approaches. Specifically, Bayes factors use the data themselves to determine their sensitivity in distinguishing theories (unlike power), and they make use of those aspects of a theory’s predictions that are often easiest to specify (unlike power and intervals, which require specifying the minimal interesting value in order to address theory). Bayes factors provide a coherent approach to determining whether non-significant results support a null hypothesis over a theory, or whether the data are just insensitive. They allow accepting and rejecting the null hypothesis to be put on an equal footing. Concrete examples are provided to indicate the range of application of a simple online Bayes calculator, which reveal both the strengths and weaknesses of Bayes factors.},

The model rests essentially on the analysis of music-related deficits in neurologically impaired individuals, but provides useful guidelines for exploring the music faculty in normal people, using methods such as neuroimaging.},

	abstract = {The paper revisits results from scale theory through the study of modes. Point of departure is the nested hierarchy of triads em- bedded into diatonic modes embedded into the chromatic scale. Generic diatonic triads can be described as stacks of thirds or as stacks of triple- fifths. These two possibilities lead to different generalizations and it is argued that the latter possibility is better suited for the understanding of harmonic tonality. Three types of well-formed modes are investigated: Simple Modes, Chain Modes, and Diazeuctic Modes. Chain Modes and Diazeuctic modes are the modal counterparts of the two types of reduced scales with the Partitioning Property in Clough and Myerson (1985), as well as of Agmon’s (1989) types A and B of generalized diatonic systems.},

To fill the need for reliable and valid Positive Affect and Negative Affect scales that are also brief and easy to administer, we developed two 10-item mood scales that comprise the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). The scales are shown to be highly internally consistent, largely uncorrelated, and stable at appropriate levels over a 2-month time period. Normative data and factorial and external evidence of convergent and discriminant validity for the scales are also presented.},

In a preliminary study and in the main experiment, subjects saw the film accompanied by one of the two soundtracks or with no soundtrack, or they heard one of the two soundtracks alone. In the main experiment, Semantic Differential judgements on Activity and Potency dimensions, obtained for the music, predicted effects of the soundtracks on corresponding ratings of the film as compared to ratings in a no soundtrack condition. As well, ratings on the Activity dimension of the film characters themselves were altered by the soundtracks. It is hypothesized that congruent auditory and visual structure directs the encoding of particular visual features of the film. In addition, associations generated by the music provide a context for the interpretation of the action in the film. As a result, stimulus features and concepts that are initially encoded as disjunctive conjoin in perception and memory.},

Three self-paced reading experiments were conducted involving the ambiguous word "that" in different syntactic environments in order to test these and other hypotheses. The data support the top-down/bottom-up approach in which the relative frequencies of lexical entries for a word are tabulated independent of context.

	abstract = {All formal differences between language and music are a consequence of differences in their fundamental building blocks (arbitrary pairings of sound and meaning in the case of language; pitch-classes and pitch-class combinations in the case of music). In all other respects, language and music are identical. In particular, we argue, developing but also extending earlier proposals by Lerdahl and Jackendoff (1983), that music, like language, contains a syntactic component in which headed structures are built by iterated, recursive, binary Merge. This is the component that Lerdahl and Jackendoff called Prolongational Reduction, which represents hierarchical patterns of tension and relaxation in tonal harmony. We further argue that the distinct component that Lerdahl and Jackendoff called Time Span Reduction is a musical prosodic component (a point anticipated by Lerdahl and Jackendoff themselves) -- whose interface with the syntactic component is strikingly similar to the comparable interface between syntactic and prosodic structure in language. Though our discussion takes Lerdahl and Jackendoff's work as a starting point and touchstone throughout, our proposals also constitute a significant realignment of their model -- necessary in order to reveal similarities between musical and linguistic structure that were not evident in their presentation. This realignment also reflects a distinction in goals between our proposal and theirs. Their work took as its starting point the question "Given a piece of music in a particular musical idiom I, what laws govern the class of analyses that a listener assigns to it in I?" Our proposals arise from a related but distinct question, more typical of generative linguistic work: "What general laws define the class of possible pieces in I?" That is, what is the grammar of I? Our realignment of Lerdahl and Jackendoff's proposals in light of the Identity Thesis allows us to ask questions not taken up in their work. For example, does Internal Merge (i.e. syntactic movement) apply in the construction of musical syntactic structure, in addition to External Merge? We argue that the phenomenon of cadence is an instance of exactly this: head-movement from the penultimate constituent of a musical passage (the dominant) to the final tonic chord. Finally, we argue that the output of musical syntax feeds a Tonal-Harmonic Component whose formal relation to the music syntax strongly resembles the relation between linguistic syntax and the semantic system that interacts with it -- and is subject to a Principle of Full Interpretation with respect to that component.},

Patel challenges the widespread belief that music and language are processed independently. Since Plato's time, the relationship between music and language has attracted interest and debate from a wide range of thinkers. Recently, scientific research on this topic has been growing rapidly, as scholars from diverse disciplines, including linguistics, cognitive science, music cognition, and neuroscience are drawn to the music-language interface as one way to explore the extent to which different mental abilities are processed by separate brain mechanisms. Accordingly, the relevant data and theories have been spread across a range of disciplines. This volume provides the first synthesis, arguing that music and language share deep and critical connections, and that comparative research provides a powerful way to study the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying these uniquely human abilities.

Three properties of musical schema are evaluated in a recognition memory experi- ment: (1)The schema engages a subset of the abstract knowledge system that is determined by the predominant key of the musical sequence, (2)the schema evaluates both interval relations and the functions of the sounded elements within the established tonal framework, and (3)the schema interacts continuously with the musical event in time to process pitch information in its temporal context. Listeners are required to identify the serial position ofa chord that is changed between two successive chord sequences that are otherwise identical. The experiment measures the magnitude and the temporal extent of the disruptive effect of including in the sequence an element outside the tonal framework. The results show temporally specific effects on memory for pitch relations consistent with the operation of a musical schema.

The task is decomposed into a series of more manageable sub-tasks; these are each modelled by Markov models, which can use contexts drawn from sym- bols describing past, current and future chords. The re- sults of a number of initial studies, for example compar- ing different types of model and the effect of corpus size, are given. There is also some discussion about harmonisa- tions that have been generated by the program by random sampling of the probability distributions in the models. Following this, a procedure for the systematic evaluation and “optimisation” of the sub-task models, involving the application of an information-theoretic measure, is pre- sented, along with some more results. An appraisal of the procedure’s shortcomings is made, and ideas for its im- provement are put forward.

The aim of the present paper is to summarize empirical findings from music cognition research that are relevant to three prominent music theoretic domains: rhythm, melody, and tonality. Attention is paid to how cognitive processes like category formation, stimulus grouping, and expectation can account for the music theoretic key concepts in these domains, such as beat, meter, voice, consonance. We give an overview of computational models that have been proposed in the literature for a variety of music processing tasks related to rhythm, melody, and tonality. Although the present state-of-the-art in computational modeling of music cognition definitely provides valuable resources for testing specific hypotheses and theories, we observe the need for models that integrate the various aspects of music perception and cognition into a single framework. Such models should be able to account for aspects that until now have only rarely been addressed in computational models of music cognition, like the active nature of perception and the development of cognitive capacities from infancy to adulthood. ?? 2008.},

Our approach is motivated by ecological validity: rather than taking musical stimuli and artificially simplifying them to make their study tractable, we have sought and found music which is appropriate to our study. We give a novel, detailed analysis of one piece, Glass’ Gradus, and show how the analysis corresponds with the information dynamics of the piece as heard. To show that this correspondence generalises, at least to music in a similar style by the same composer, we go on to analyse Glass’ Two Pages. We suggest that this research provides further evidence that information-dynamic modelling is a worthwhile approach to the study of music cognition and also has the potential, if automated, to be a powerful tool to increase objectivity in data-based music analysis.},

The notions of «predicative thinking» versus «functional thinking» describe a cognitive pattern that tries to explain the preference or even special capability for either one of the two view points. Meanwhile, there are not only numerous qualitative experimental results that prove the usefulness of this theoretical construct, but also an EEG-study and several studies involving eye-movement analysis that emphasise quantitative evidence. As aspects of predicative thinking have been studied quite frequently in cognitive psychology, there is an accumulated need for studies of functional thinking. Primary school education shows that functional approaches have been neglected in spite of advocates of the operational principle. Anyhow, there are didactical materials like the Addition-, Multiplication-Landscape, the spiral staircase for calculating or the Dynamic Labyrinths that are very well suited to demand and promote functional thinking.},

Musicians performed better than nonmusicians in recognizing familiar musical phrases and classifying terminal notes. The differences found as a function of expertise were larger for unfamiliar than for familiar melodies. The ERPs to the end notes differed both in terms of amplitude and latency between musicians and nonmusicians, and as a function of participants' familiarity with the melodies and type of violation.

Without doubt the phenomenon of combination tones is connected with nonlinear phenomena in the human ear. Therefore, it is generally assumed that the explanation of this phenomenon is possible on the level of the ear. This paper proposes different approach, which assumes the existence of an additional mechanism beyond the ear. The aim of this mechanism is to diminish sensitivity of the auditory process to nonlinear distortions by appropriate decoding of sound information. The general rule of construction and the mathematical model of such a mechanism is proposed, which allows for the explanation of many problems associated with combination tones. As a consequence an unexpected result is obtained with regard to a combination tone 2f1-f2 that it can originate already from the nonlinear distortion of the second order. This mathematical model is formulated in terms of finite groups.},

The proposed theory is an expansion of Fred Lerdahl's tonal pitch space model; its purpose is a more accurate description of the situations involved in the analysis of diatonic modal music. The original methodology and set of algebraic calculating formulae is retained, but it is applied on modal instead of tonal space, on the basis that the latter is a subset of the former. In connection to Fred Lerdahl's theory, melodic motion, chord attraction and various cadence types are described within the modal context. Apart from the calculation of the pitch and the chordal and regional space algebraic representations, geometric representations of all three levels of the modal pitch space are also included. Finally, the stability conditions arising from the new model are used as criteria to build the time span reduction and prolongational reduction parts of the Generative Theory of Tonal Music (GTTM) analysis of modal music. Two short GTTM analyses of 20th century modal music are being presented to illustrate the new model's analytical use.},

	url = {http://ojs.gold.ac.uk/index.php/sysmus14/article/view/243},
	abstract = {The subject of this paper is the cognition of triadic progressions in 19th century tonal music. Music psychological research concerning the cognition of harmonic progressions mainly relies on diatonic music in which triads are easily relatable to a key. Triadic distance is therefore measured in terms of root relationships to the tonal center, the tonic (Krumhansl \& Kessler, 1982). This conception is not directly applicable to chromatic music where musical coherence is not only obtained by common a key. Transformational music theory puts strong emphasis on voice-leading parsimony as a measure of distance. The most efficient transformations between major and minor triads are P (parallel), R (relative) and L (leading-tone exchange), which is also in accordance with empirical findings of diatonic triadic relatedness (Krumhansl, 1998). Notably, P and R generate an octatonic scale containing eight major and minor triads which are claimed to be functionally equivalent. Transformational analyses result in sequential patterns of triadic progressions and an overarching key is not required. Based on an extended notion of function and acknowledging that there are compelling arguments for both hierarchical and sequential representations of the cognition of harmonic progressions a multi-level model is proposed that combines both approaches, adopting features of the generative model by Rohrmeier (2011). The two main components of the model are the concept of functional equivalence and the distinction between the hierarchic-syntactic cognition of functional progressions and the schematic cognition of functional values.},

To construct this theory, Euclid introduced in Book II the problem of dividing a segment into extreme and mean ratio (the “golden section”).

According to the dynamic attending theory (DAT) external regularities can entrain internal oscillators that guide attention over time, inducing temporal expectations that influence perception of future events. In the present study, the presentation of the artificial pitch grammar in the exposure phase was temporally either regular or irregular for one of two participant groups. Based on the DAT, it was hypothesized that the regular temporal presentation would favour implicit learning of tone structures in comparison to the irregular temporal presentation. Results demonstrated learning of the artificial grammar for the group with the regular exposure phase and partial learning for the group with the irregular exposure phase. These findings suggest that the regular presentation helps listeners to develop perceptual expectations about the temporal occurrence of future tones and thus facilitates the learning of the artificial pitch grammar.},

	abstract = {Context-free grammars are fundamental for the description of linguistic syntax. However, most artificial grammar learning experiments have explored learning of simpler finite-state grammars, while studies exploring context-free grammars have not assessed awareness and implicitness. This paper explores the implicit learning of context-free grammars employing features of hierarchical organization, recursive embedding and long-distance dependencies. The grammars also featured the distinction between left- and right-branching structures, as well as between centre- and tail-embedding, both distinctions found in natural languages. People acquired unconscious knowledge of relations between grammatical classes even for dependencies over long distances, in ways that went beyond learning simpler relations (e.g. n-grams) between individual words. The structural distinctions drawn from linguistics also proved important as performance was greater for tail-embedding than centre-embedding structures. The results suggest the plausibility of implicit learning of complex context-free structures, which model some features of natural languages. They support the relevance of artificial grammar learning for probing mechanisms of language learning and challenge existing theories and computational models of implicit learning.},

	abstract = {Harmonic priming studies have shown that a musical context with its tonal center influences target chord processing. In comparison with targets following baseline contexts, which do not establish a specific tonal center, processing is facilitated for a strongly related target functioning as the tonic, but inhibited for unrelated (out-of-key) and less related (subdominant) targets. This study investigated cost and benefit patterns for the processing of the 3 most important chords of the harmonic hierarchy. Response time patterns reflected the chords' ranking: Processing was fastest for the tonic, followed by the dominant, and then the subdominant. The comparison with baseline contexts replicated the benefit of processing for tonic targets (Experiments 1 and 3) and the cost of processing for subdominant targets (Experiment 3), while dominant targets were situated at baseline level (Experiments 1 to 3). Findings indicate that listeners implicitly understand fine differences in tonal stabilities and confirm the special status of the tonic being the most expected and solely facilitated chord at the end of a tonal context. Findings are discussed with references to sensory and cognitive approaches of music perception.},

Differentiation distinguishes elements from one another and was varied in terms of the distribution of pitch durations within tone sequences.

Multiple experiments demonstrated that the perception of tonality depended on a minimal degree of differentiation in the distribution of the duration--but not frequency of occurrence --of pitches and only when pitch distributions were hierarchically organized. Moreover, the mere differentiation of the tonic from nontonic pitches was not sufficient to induce tonal percepts.

A novel evaluation framework was applied, which alternates forced binary grammaticality judgments and subsequent learning of the same stimulus. Our results indicate a strong online learning effect for n-gram and chunking models and a weaker effect for simple recurrent network models. Such findings suggest that online learning is a plausible effect of statistical chunk learning that is possible when ungrammatical sequences contain a large proportion of grammatical chunks. Such common effects of continuous statistical learning may underlie statistical and implicit learning paradigms and raise implications for study design and testing methodologies.},

Two experiments explore implicit learning of hierarchical harmonic structures of different complexity employing an artificial grammar learning paradigm. The experiments consisted of an incidental learning phase using a distraction task, and a testing phase employing the process dissociation procedure paradigm (Jacoby, 1991). Participants performed significantly above chance and recognised adjacent and long-distance dependencies in both experiments. Confidence ratings and inclusion/exclusion response patterns suggest that both implicit structure knowledge and explicit judgment knowledge are in operation. Participants recognised stimuli with deep structures that appeared in the learning phase better than new structures for the more complex grammar, whereas there was no such difference for the simpler grammar. They performed significantly better for the less complex grammar which indicates that grammatical complexity affects learnability and recognition performance. The results conform to other experimental findings that musicians and nonmusicians are able to perceive long-distance dependencies and embedded structures in tonal harmony.},

While the concept of prediction is unproblematic for basic single-stream features such as melody, it is not straight-forward for polyphonic structures or higher-order features such as formal predictions. Behavioural results based on explicit and implicit (priming) paradigms provide evidence of priming in various domains that may reflect predictive behaviour. Computational learning models, including symbolic (fragment-based), probabilistic/graphical, or connectionist approaches, provide well-specified predictive models of specific features and feature combinations. While models match some experimental results, full-fledged music prediction cannot yet be modelled. Neuroscientific results regarding the early right-anterior negativity (ERAN) and mismatch negativity (MMN) reflect expectancy violations on different levels of processing complexity, and provide some neural evidence for different predictive mechanisms.

In this paper we provide a description of the listener’s knowledge of hierarchies of harmonic stability. The organization of harmonic information may be summarized by Osix principles. Three of these principles-Key Membership, Intrakey Distance and Intrakey Asymmetry-govern harmonic organization independent of context. Three principles-Contextual Identity, Contextual Distance and Contextual Asymmetry-govern harmonic organization in the presence of a tonal context. Chords that are members of the same key are represented in a hierarchy of stability that is independent of context. chords from different keys are represented in a hierarchy of stability that is dependent upon the prevailing context. Two different experimental tasks were used to provide convergent evidence for these principles: 1) multidimensional scaling of chords in the absence of any context or in the presence of different tonal contexts, and 2) recognition memory for chords in random and tonal contexts. It is suggested that harmonically stable chords function as cognitive reference points for the system as a whole.

	abstract = {The fundamental claim of this thesis is that music perception and cognition are embodied, situated activities. This means that they depend crucially on the physical constraints and enablings of our sensorimotor apparatus, and also on the ecological and sociocultural environment in which our music-listening and -producing capacities come into being. I argue that rhythm perception and production involve a complex, whole-body experience, and that much of the musical structure found in rhythm-based music incorporates an awareness of the embodied, situated role of the participant. The claim that music perception and cognition are embodied activities also means that they are actively constructed by the listener, rather than passively transferred from performer to listener. In particular, the discernment of entities such as pulse and meter from a given piece of music are not perceptual inevitabilities for any human being, but are strongly dependent on the persons culturally contingent listening strategies. In addition, I argue that certain kinds of rhythmic expression in what I call groove-based music are directly related not only to the role of the body in making music, but also to certain cultural aesthetics that privilege this role. Some common kinds of subtle microrhythmic variation are shown to display systematic structure, which often carries an encoded sonic trace of the music-making body. Throughout the text are included a number of illustrative musical examples, drawn from West African and African-American musical genres. The focus on this group of cultures stems from the salient role of embodied and situated dimensions in these particular musics, and from the authors expertise in their performance and analysis. However, these musics merely form a case study for the more general claim that these dimensions are operative in all music to varying degrees.},

	abstract = {Direct ratio scaling (e.g., magnitude estimation; Stevens, 1956, American Journal of Psychology) is a widely used approach in psychophysics resting on the assumption that participants are able to refer to sensations with numbers that are valid on a ratio scale. Only recently, the necessary conditions of commutativity and multiplicativity have been formulated (Narens, 1996, Journal of Mathematical Psychology) and tested empirically, e.g., for the sensation of loudness. The present investigation evaluated these properties for the ratio production of pitch intervals. Musically trained (n = 10) and untrained (n = 11) participants adjusted intervals defined by two ascending pure-tone frequencies to given fractions (1/3, 1/2, 2/3), starting either from a 12 or 17-semitone standard pitch interval. The results show that the axioms of commutativity and multiplicativity held for most of the participants, irrespective of musical training. Furthermore, all participants produced larger frequency intervals in response to larger ratio numbers used in the instructions (monotonicity), but only musically trained participants were sensitive to the size of the standard interval (thus producing strictly increasing magnitudes). Overall, the results indicate that pitch intervals are ratio-scalable. However, restrictions must be made, especially for non-musical listeners, and when an octave is exceeded.},

	abstract = {Rhythm as the time structure of music is composed of distinct temporal components such as pattern, meter, and tempo. Each feature requires different computational processes: meter involves representing repeating cycles of strong and weak beats; pattern involves representing intervals at each local time point which vary in length across segments and are linked hierarchically; and tempo requires representing frequency rates of underlying pulse structures. We explored whether distinct rhythmic elements engage different neural mechanisms by recording brain activity of adult musicians and non-musicians with positron emission tomography (PET) as they made covert same-different discriminations of (a) pairs of rhythmic, monotonic tone sequences representing changes in pattern, tempo, and meter, and (b) pairs of isochronous melodies. Common to pattern, meter, and tempo tasks were focal activities in right, or bilateral, areas of frontal, cingulate, parietal, prefrontal, temporal, and cerebellar cortices. Meter processing alone activated areas in right prefrontal and inferior frontal cortex associated with more cognitive and abstract representations. Pattern processing alone recruited right cortical areas involved in different kinds of auditory processing. Tempo processing alone engaged mechanisms subserving somatosensory and premotor information (e.g., posterior insula, postcentral gyrus). Melody produced activity different from the rhythm conditions (e.g., right anterior insula and various cerebellar areas). These exploratory findings suggest the outlines of some distinct neural components underlying the components of rhythmic structure.},

This sensitivity is considered in a cross-cultural context using two styles of music, Finnish spiritual folk hymns and North Sami yoiks. Previous research on melodic continuation judgments showed strong correlations with the statistics of the musical style, specifically, the tone distributions and two- and three-tone transitions. This article develops models using these three kinds of statistics to categorize short initial segments as coming from one style or the other. The model using tone distributions was found to make numerous categorization errors, which can be understood because the tone distributions for these styles are similar. However, categorization was better for the models that used two- and three-tone transitions. The major differences between the transitional probabilities in the styles were analyzed, and these differences were used to account for the cases that the models found difficult. These results point to listeners' sensitivity to higher order transition information and its utility for style identification.},

	abstract = {Bilinguals and musicians exhibit behavioral advantages on tasks with high demands on executive functioning, particularly inhibitory control, but the brain mechanisms supporting these differences are unclear. Of key interest is whether these forms of experience influence cognition through similar or distinct information processing mechanisms. Here, we recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) in three groups - bilinguals, musicians, and controls - who completed a visual go-nogo task that involved the withholding of key presses to rare targets. Participants in each group achieved similar accuracy rates and responses times but the analysis of cortical responses revealed significant differences in ERP waveforms. Success in withholding a prepotent response was associated with enhanced stimulus-locked N2 and P3 wave amplitude relative to go trials. For nogo trials, there were altered timing-specific ERP differences and graded amplitude differences observed in the neural responses across groups. Specifically, musicians showed an enhanced early P2 response accompanied by reduced N2 amplitude whereas bilinguals showed increased N2 amplitude coupled with an increased late positivity wave relative to controls. These findings demonstrate that bilingualism and music training have differential effects on the brain networks supporting executive control over behavior.},

	abstract = {In the past, notions of embodiment have been applied to robotics mainly in the realm of very simple robots, and supporting low-level mechanisms such as dynamics and navigation. In contrast, most human-like, interactive, and socially adept robotic systems turn away from embodiment and use amodal, symbolic, and modular approaches to cognition and interaction. At the same time, recent research in Embodied Cognition (EC) is spanning an increasing number of complex cognitive processes, including language, nonverbal communication, learning, and social behavior. This article suggests adopting a modern EC approach for autonomous robots interacting with humans. In particular, we present three core principles from EC that may be applicable to such robots: (a) modal perceptual representation, (b) action/perception and action/cognition integration, and (c) a simulation-based model of top-down perceptual biasing. We describe a computational framework based on these principles, and its implementation on two physical robots. This could provide a new paradigm for embodied human-robot interaction based on recent psychological and neurological findings.},

One view, which I will label body functionalism, takes the body to play the functional role of linking external resources for problem solving with internal biological machinery. Embodiment is thus understood in terms of the role the body plays in supporting the computational circuits that realize cognition. Body enactivism argues by contrast that no computational account of cognition can account for the role of commonsense knowledge in our everyday practical engagement with the world.

Theories of embodied cognition provide a structure within which we can investigate the mechanisms underlying action's impact on thinking and reasoning.

In addition, we show that a nomological network of evidence (Schmitt \& Pilcher, 2004) can be built around the hypothesis that musicality is a cognitive adaptation. Within this network, different modes of evidence are gathered to support a specific evolutionary hypothesis.

Participants acquired knowledge of grammatical melodic structures under incidental learning conditions in both experimental and untrained control conditions. Subsequent analysis indicates a large effect of unsupervised online learning in the experimental and control group throughout the course of the testing phase suggesting an effective ongoing learning process. Musicians did not outperform nonmusicians, indicating that musical expertise is not advantageous for the learning of a new, unfamiliar melodic system.

The evolution of language toward the semantically powerful tool of today required emancipation from emotional encumbrances. Opposing, but no less powerful, mechanisms required a compensatory evolution of music toward more differentiated and refined emotionality. The need for refined music is grounded in fundamental mechanisms of the mind. This is why today’s human mind and cultures cannot exist without today’s music.

The 31 subjects’ experimen- tal task was to sing back a novel melody presented either as single note MIDI melody or as the vocal melodies in audio excerpts from real pop songs. Each subject was tested with 14 different melodies and could use up to 6 tri- als for each melody. The aim of the data analysis was to predict the similarity between the original melody and the sung recalls by the subjects. The similarity was measured with different algorithmic measures reflecting various structural aspects of melodies, e.g. melodic contour, inter- vals, rhythm, or melodic accents. Among the results of the data analysis are the descriptions of different learning curves for the different structural aspects over trials, and the general importance or persistence of the different musi- cal dimensions in memory. Although the study was carried out with 31 subjects due to the very time consuming proc- ess of transcription of the subjects’ sung recalls, the pre- liminary data analysis presented in ties paper is based solely on 10 subjects.},

A study by Todd, Cousins \& Lee (2007) yielded evidence suggesting that body size is a possible determining physical factor in beat perception, i.e. the larger the body, the longer the preferred beat period (PBP). We report here a follow-up experiment investigating the relationship between body size, performance on motor tasks, and PBP, and possible mediating effects of musicality and mood state. 40 subjects completed a mixed design experiment, incorporating anthropometric measurements, motor tasks (walking and tapping, estimating preferred step period and spontaneous inter-tap interval respectively), psychometric tests of mood, and a measure of musicality, alongside the perceptual paradigm estimating PBP used by Todd et al. (2007). Using a variety of methods of statistical analysis, we found some evidence of a positive relationship between (some) anthropometric variables and both preferred step period and PBP, as predicted, as well as suggestive evidence of effects of musicality and mood variables.},

First, a quick overview of our mathematical systematization for similarity measures, including data transformations and calculation methods is given. Behavioral data from three listener experiments is used to model experts’ similarity judgments of short melodies from popular music in different contextual situations. A weighted combination of several similarity measures, representing two resp. three different sources of information, is found to explain user ratings best. As an application example one of the optimal similarity measures resulting from these three experiments is used to analyze a body of about 600 folk melodies from Luxembourg. Finally, the expert classification of the individual phrases of these melodies that has carried out in an extensive ethno-musicological study (Sagrillo, 1999) is reconstructed with the help of an optimal combination of similarity measures using logistic regression.},

Considering historical evidence of the evolution of cultures and consciousness, a parallel evolution of music as a powerful and unifying emotional mechanism is demonstrated and recent cognitive experiments that have confirmed this hypothesis are summarized. The neural mechanisms of music include mental representations which unify the entire life experience. It follows that music is fundamental in making human evolution possible. The human mind and our human cultures would not exist as they do today without music. Future theoretical and experimental research directions are outlined.},

	title = {The construction and evaluation of statistical models of melodic structure in music perception and composition},
	abstract = {The prevalent approach to developing cognitive models of music perception and composition is to construct systems of symbolic rules and constraints on the basis of extensive music-theoretic and music-analytic knowledge. The the- sis proposed in this dissertation is that statistical models which acquire knowl- edge through the induction of regularities in corpora of existing music can, if examined with appropriate methodologies, provide significant insights into the cognitive processing involved in music perception and composition. This claim is examined in three stages. First, a number of statistical modelling techniques drawn from the fields of data compression, statistical language modelling and machine learning are subjected to empirical evaluation in the context of se- quential prediction of pitch structure in unseen melodies. This investigation results in a collection of modelling strategies which together yield significant performance improvements over existing methods. In the second stage, these statistical systems are used to examine observed patterns of expectation col- lected in previous psychological research on melody perception. In contrast to previous accounts of this data, the results demonstrate that these patterns of expectation can be accounted for in terms of the induction of statistical regu- larities acquired through exposure to music. In the final stage of the present research, the statistical systems developed in the first stage are used to examine the intrinsic computational demands of the task of composing a stylistically suc- cessful melody. The results suggest that the systems lack the degree of expres- sive power needed to consistently meet the demands of the task. In contrast to previous research, however, the methodological framework developed for the evaluation of computationalmodels of composition enables a detailed empirical examination and comparison of suchmodels which facilitates the identification and resolution of their weaknesses.},

However, previous studies have argued against the perception of such structures in music. Here, we show processing of nonlocal dependencies in music. We presented chorales by J. S. Bach and modified versions in which the hierarchical structure was rendered irregular whereas the local structure was kept intact. Brain electric responses differed between regular and irregular hierarchical structures, in both musicians and nonmusicians. This finding indicates that, when listening to music, humans apply cognitive processes that are capable of dealing with long-distance dependencies resulting from hierarchically organized syntactic structures. Our results reveal that a brain mechanism fundamental for syntactic processing is engaged during the perception of music, indicating that processing of hierarchical structure with nested nonlocal dependencies is not just a key component of human language, but a multidomain capacity of human cognition.},

	abstract = {The leitmotives in Richard Wagner’s Der Ring des Nibelungen serve a range of compositional and psychological functions, including the introduction of musical structure and mnemonic devices for the listener. Leitmotives in the Ring differ greatly in their construction, salient aspects (e.g. rhythmic, melodic, harmonic), and their usage in particular scenes and contexts. We aim to understand listeners’ real-time processing of leitmotives, and have gathered data from a memory test, probing participants’ memory for different leit- motives contained in a 10-minute excerpt from the opera Siegfried. An item response theory (IRT) approach was used to estimate item difficulty parameters as well as parameters characterizing participants’ individual recognition ability. We fit a series of IRT models to the data obtained from 68 participants, finding that a Rasch Model with an unconstrained but fixed discrimination parameter fit the data best accord- ing to the Bayesian Information Criterion. We further investigated the relationship between model parameters and factors such as: number of leitmotive occurrences in the excerpt; acoustical distance using chroma features (Mauch \& Dixon, 2010) and distance thresholding (Casey, Rhodes \& Slaney, 2008); extent of musical training; and objective and self-reported Wagner expertise, finding that performance in the objective Wagner test and chroma distance were statistically significant predictors, while number of occurrences, self-reported Wagner expertise and extent of musical training did not reach significance.},

Human subjects were presented visually with target words after hearing either a spoken sentence or a musical excerpt. Target words that were semantically unrelated to prime sentences elicited a larger N400 than did target words that were preceded by semantically related sentences. In addition, target words that were preceded by semantically unrelated musical primes showed a similar N400 effect, as compared to target words preceded by related musical primes. The N400 priming effect did not differ between language and music with respect to time course, strength or neural generators.

	abstract = {Tonality and Transformation is a groundbreaking study in the analysis of tonal music. Focusing on the listener's experience, author Steven Rings employs transformational music theory to illuminate diverse aspects of tonal hearing - from the infusion of sounding pitches with familiar tonal qualities to sensations of directedness and attraction. In the process, Rings introduces a host of new analytical techniques for the study of the tonal repertory, demonstrating their application in vivid interpretive set pieces on music from Bach to Mahler. The analyses place the book's novel techniques in dialogue with existing tonal methodologies, such as Schenkerian theory, avoiding partisan debate in favor of a methodologically careful, pluralistic approach. Rings also engages neo-Riemannian theory-a popular branch of transformational thought focused on chromatic harmony-reanimating its basic operations with tonal dynamism and bringing them into closer rapprochement with traditional tonal concepts. Written in a direct and engaging style, with lively prose and plain-English descriptions of all technical ideas, Tonality and Transformation balances theoretical substance with accessibility: it will appeal to both specialists and non-specialists. It is a particularly attractive volume for those new to transformational theory: in addition to its original theoretical content, the book offers an excellent introduction to transformational thought, including a chapter that outlines the theory's conceptual foundations and formal apparatus, as well as a glossary of common technical terms. A contribution to our understanding of tonal phenomenology and a landmark in the analytical application of transformational techniques, Tonality and Transformation is an indispensible work of music theory [Publisher description]},

Given a string of triads representing a harmonic analysis of a piece, the task is to identify and label all substrings corresponding to these cycles with high accuracy. The solution method uses a noisy channel model implemented with weighted finitestate transducers. On a dataset of four works by Franz Schubert, our model predicted cycles in the same regions as cycles in the ground truth with a precision of 0.18 and a recall of 1.0. The recalled cycles had an average edit distance of 3.2 insertions or deletions from the ground truth cycles, which average 6.4 labeled triads in length. We suggest ways in which our model could be used to contribute to current work in music theory, and be generalized to other music pattern-finding applications.},

Neo-Riemannian theory not only allowed for the mathematical construction and description of these sets, some of which later were called the Hexatonic Systems, but also a means to explain how these systems were used. Involving the application of the P LR Operations, the analysis of the Hexatonic Systems is a primary component of neo-Riemannian theory.

the most famous of which is the group of “neo-Riemannian” transformations acting on the set of major and minor triads. David Lewin (1982,
1987) first described neo-Riemannian transformations, building on work
by von Oettingen (1866) and Hugo Riemann (1880). In general, contextual
transformations act on multisets of pitches or pitch classes and commute
with transposition and inversion. Music theorists have studied contextual
transformation groups extensively; in particular, Lewin (1987), Kochavi
(1998), Cohn (1997), and Fiore and Satyendra (2005) used discrete group
theory, while Clough (1998) and Gollin (1998) modeled contextual transformations with symmetries of discrete geometric spaces. We represent
contextual transformations as linear transformations acting on sequences
of pitches or pitch classes belonging to the continuous geometric voiceleading spaces developed by Callender, Quinn, and Tymoczko (2008).
Subtleties arise that have not been explored in discrete models. Connections to tuning theory, neo-Riemannian theory, serial transformations,
and musical examples from di Lasso, Brahms, and Schubert demonstrate
the benefits of this approach.},

	abstract = {Analytical approaches to musical analysis have generally attempted to provide some kind of justification, and, in the last decades, to develop analytical elements based on tesselations of pitch class sets. When applied to atonal music, analytical approaches frequently fail to find internal coherence. Most of the time, tilings of chords are based on a torus representation, which follows the traditional principles of functional harmonic progression. A possible solution for determining a nice coherence of atonal chords progression is dependent on the topology of the tesselation involved. In the first section, we show that some tilings of chords could be related to the Klein bottle or to the projective plane. It is well known that tesselations are connected with groups. Consequently, possibilities of musical analyses can be suggested through a theoretical group approach. In the second section, we consider the neo-Riemannian theory, and suggest a number of revisions. We substitute the contextual transformations by three pointwise operations based on permutations, in order to link harmonic hierarchical or categorized structures with permutation groups. In the last section, we draw upon Olivier Messiaen’s works in order to show that some groups are more suitable than others for analytical approaches, but in any case, are related to some permutation groups.},

provides a powerful tool for thinking about voice leading, one that can be used to answer
familiar objections to the very notion of a voice leading between pitch-class sets. I begin
by generalizing the traditional Western system of musical notation, defining paths in
pitch-class space, and showing that key signatures are collections of such paths. I then
show that it is always possible to find a minimal voice leading that has no voice
crossings; however, it is not always possible to avoid voice crossings while maximizing
common-tone retention. I describe a general method for identifying a minimal voice
leading between arbitrary chords, and show that our familiar system of diatonic key
signatures implements this method. I conclude by deriving a set of key signatures for the
acoustic scale. These key signatures represent minimal voice leadings from the diatonic
to the acoustic collection, and are interestingly related to the familiar diatonic key
signatures.},

	title = {Three {Conceptions} of {Musical} {Distance}},
	abstract = {This paper considers three conceptions of musical distance (or
inverse “similarity”) that produce three different musico-geometrical spaces:
the first, based on voice leading, yields a collection of continuous quotient
spaces or orbifolds; the second, based on acoustics, gives rise to the Tonnetz
and related “tuning lattices”; while the third, based on the total interval content
of a group of notes, generates a six-dimensional “quality space” first described
by Ian Quinn. I will show that although these three measures are in principle
quite distinct, they are in practice surprisingly interrelated. This poses the
challenge of determining which model is appropriate to a given musictheoretical circumstance. Since the different models can produce comparable
results, unwary theorists could potentially find themselves using one type of
structure (such as a tuning lattice) to investigate properties more perspicuously
represented by another (for instance, voice-leading relationships).},

quantizing continuous chords to a scale, deriving some new results in this more general

second part of the paper, I show how Clough and Douthett’s “Jfunction” began as a
device for generating maximally even collections, only later evolving into a tool for
studying the voice leadings between them. Particularly important here are Julian Hook’s
“signature transformations,” which I generalize to a wider range of collections. I
conclude with a few remarks about history and methodology in music theory.},

	abstract = {This study conducted a perceptual analysis of an excerpt from Beethoven's Waldstein piano sonata in four experiments. The experiments were followed by an application of Lerdahl's (2001) Tonal Pitch Space theory, or TPS, to perceptual judgments of musical tension over the course of the excerpt. In the experiments, data were obtained for each of 15 time points corresponding to the 15 successive sonorities in the excerpt. Listeners in the first three experiments were piano students who learned and performed the excerpt before participating in the experimental tasks. In Experiment 1, judgments of phrase structure permitted examination of the perceptual segmentation of the excerpt. In Experiment 2, probe-tone ratings (Krumhansl and Kessler, 1982) were used to derive both a measure of perceived distance traveled in key space as well as a measure of temporal orientation — the degree to which listening at each time point was retrospective or prospective. In Experiment 3, a tension contour over the 15 time points was derived from listeners' continuous responding to perceived tension throughout the excerpt. In Experiment 4, judgments of consonance/dissonance for each sonority, isolated from context and presented in random order in a randomly selected transposition, were obtained from piano students unfamiliar with the excerpt. Strong correspondences were found between the perceptual measures and related music-theoretic predictors generated from TPS. The tension contour was regressed on TPS predictors. Both sensitivity to hierarchical structure and expectancies arising from voice leading, as well as the overall melodic contour, significantly contributed to the prediction of perceived tension.},

	abstract = {Congenital  amusia  (amusia,  hereafter)  is  a  developmental  disorder  that  impacts  negatively  on
the perception of music. Psychophysical testing suggests that individuals with amusia have above
average  thresholds  for  detection  of  pitch  change  and  pitch  direction  discrimination;  however,
a low-level auditory perceptual problem cannot completely explain the disorder, since discrimination of melodies is also impaired when the constituent intervals are suprathreshold for perception.
the aim of the present study was to test pitch memory as a function of (a) time and (b) tonal interference, in order to determine whether pitch traces are inherently weaker in amusic individuals.
Memory for the pitch of single tones was compared using two versions of a paradigm developed
by deutsch (1970a). in both tasks, participants compared the pitch of a standard (s) versus a comparison (c) tone. in the time task, the sand ctones were presented, separated in time by 0, 1, 5, 10,
and 15 s (blocked presentation). in the interference task, the sand ctones were presented with
a fixed time interval (5 s) but with a variable number of irrelevant tones in between: 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8
tones (blocked presentation). in the time task, control performance remained high for all time intervals, but amusics showed a performance decrement over time. in the interference task, controls
and amusics showed a similar performance decrement with increasing number of irrelevant tones.
overall, the results suggest that the pitch representations of amusic individuals are less stable and
more prone to decay than those of matched non-amusic individuals.},

The various modes differ in attainable precision, likely errors, and ease of use. A combination of such modes can be used to formulate an “ideal” model for interpreting scientific concepts both reliably and efficiently. Comparisons are made with the actual concept interpretations of expert scientists and novice students. The discussion elucidates some cognitive and metacognitive reasons why the learning of scientific or mathematical concepts is difficult.

	abstract = {The issue of the emergence of major-minor tonality is addressed by recourse to a novel pitch grouping process, referred to as interval cycle proximity (ICP). An interval cycle is the minimum number of (additive) iterations of an interval that are required for octave-related pitches to be re-stated, a property conjectured to be responsible for tonal attraction. It is hypothesised that the actuation of ICP in cognition, possibly in the latter part of the sixteenth century, led to a hierarchy of tonal attraction which favoured certain pitches over others, ostensibly the tonics of the modern major and minor system. An ICP model is described that calculates the level of tonal attraction between adjacent musical elements. The predictions of the model are shown to be consistent with music-theoretic accounts of common practice period tonality, including Piston's Table of Usual Root Progressions. The development of tonality is illustrated with the historical quotations of commentators from the sixteenth to the eighteenth centuries, and can be characterised as follows. At the beginning of the seventeenth century multiple 'finals' were possible, each associated with a different interval configuration (mode). By the end of the seventeenth century, however, only two interval configurations were in regular use: those pertaining to the modern majorminor key system. The implications of this development are discussed with respect interval cycles and their hypothesised effect within music.},

The model predicts the level of tonal attraction between temporally adjacent chords. The functional ambiguity of nineteenth-century chromatic harmony can be problematic: chromatic chords, unlike diatonic harmony, often have ill-defined roots, and thus their proper functions are difficult to establish. An important feature of the model, however,is that the key or tonal context of the music does not need tobe specified. The model is based on the ideaof ‘interval cycle proximity’(\{ICP)\}, a grouping mechanism hypothesized to contribute to the perception of tonal \{attraction.This\} paper illustrates the model with an analysis of the opening of Wagner’s \{‘Tristan\} und Isolde’, and showsthat the model can predict the opening sequence of \{‘Tristan’\} in terms of tonal attraction without the chords needing to be functionally specified.},

@phdthesis{chew_towards_2000,
	title = {Towards a {Mathematical} {Model} of {Tonality}},
	abstract = {This dissertation addresses the question of how musical pitches generate a tonal center. Being able to characterize the relationships that generate a tonal center is crucial to the computer analysis and the generating of western tonal music. It also can inform issues of compositional styles, structural boundaries, and performance decisions. The proposed Spiral Array model offers a parsimonious description of the inter-relations among tonal elements, and suggests new ways to re-conceptualize and reorganize musical information. The Spiral Array generates representations for pitches, intervals, chords and keys within a single spatial framework, allowing comparisons among elements from different hierarchical levels. Structurally, this spatial representation is a helical realization of the harmonic network (tonnetz). The basic idea behind the Spiral Array is the representation of higher level tonal elements as composites of their lower level parts. The Spiral Array assigns greatest prominence to perfect fifth and major/minor third interval relations, placing elements related by these intervals in proximity to each other. As a result, distances between tonal entities as represented spatially in the model correspond to perceived distances among sounding entities. The parameter values that affect proximity relations are prescribed based on a few perceived relations among pitches, intervals, chords and keys. This process of interfacing between the model and actual perception creates the opportunity to research some basic, but till now unanswered questions about the relationships that generate tonality. A generative model, the Spiral Array also provides a framework on which to design viable and effcient algorithms for problems in music cognition. I demonstrate its versatility by applying the model to three different problems: I develop an algorithm to determine the key of musical passages that, on average, performs better than existing ones when applied to the 24 fugue subjects in Book 1 of Bach's \{WTC;\} I propose the first computationally viable method for determining modulations (the change of key); and, I design a basic algorithm for finding the roots of chords, comparing its results to those of algorithms by other researchers. All three algorithms were implemented in Matlab.},

While Deutsch's attention was focused on `bootstraping' of tonal and event hierarchies, the term has been used more broadly to refer to other possible instances of co-generating mental representations; one example is seen in the proposition that metrical cues help to guide judgments of tonality, while tonal and harmonic cues simultaneously serve as metrical cues. This paper will make some connections among some of the theoretical and experimental literature contributed in the past decade; these connections seem to indicate that aural key recognition may be an elaborate example of this sort of co-generation. The most reasonable reaction to this literature may be to admit that although it is possible to arrange tonal pitch information within a fairly coherent hierarchy in the abstract, the perceptual activity of getting one's tonal bearings within that hierarchy may involve sampling idiosyncratically from several different levels within it. But it would be helpful first to review the literature leading up to these hunches.},

This property characterizes positive standard words among their conjugates with respect to plain adjointness. The plain adjoint of the Ionian step-interval pattern aaba{\textbar}aab is the Ionian fifth-up/fourth-down folding pattern yx{\textbar}yxyxy. Three different kinds of mathematical objects are associated with one another: affine automorphisms of Z\_n, trajectories \{\vphantom{\}}0, ..., n] --{\textgreater} Z x Z traversing lifts of the graphs of affine automorphisms to fundamental domains of Z\_n x Z\_n within Z x Z, and well-formed words encoding the zigzag patterns of the trajectories in terms of binary words. Inversion of affine automorphisms is thereby associated with an extension of the duality of Christoffel words to their conjugates. Plain adjointness for positive standard words has a transformational expression in terms of the monoid-anti-automorphism of the special standard monoid.  Positive standard words are images of the word ab unter special standard morphisms f e (G, D). Plain adjointness corresponds to the reversal of the order of f. The factorization of f(ab) into the two factors f(a) and f(b) coincides with the authentic division.},

	abstract = {Hegels Kunstbegriff wird aus dem Zentrum seines Philosophierens, d. h. aus der Logik entwickelt. Es zeigt sich erstens, daß Hegels Philosophie nicht thetisch ist, weil sie ein selbst standpunktloses Durchlaufen von Standpunkten ist, in dessen Verlauf das Denken jeweils in grundsätzlich verschiedener Weise zum Stehen kommt (Seins-, Wesens- Begriffslogik). Thematisch wird dies in Hegels Auffassung des Seins als eines Momentes am Übergang von Seins- zu Wesenslogik. Insofern das Sein ein Moment, d. h. Begriffsmoment des Wesens ist, ist es aus dem Wesen ableitbar, welches selbst folglich jenseits von Sein und Nicht-Sein gedacht werden muß. Die genaue Rekonstruktion dieses Zusammenhangs erlaubt es, die Frage nach dem Verhältnis Logik-Realphilosophie (Entschluß der Idee) in einer Weise zu lösen, die zugleich sichtbar macht, auf welche Frage eigentlich Hegel mit diesem und verwandten Theoriestücken (z. B.: ontologischer Beweis) antwortet. Es zeigt sich, daß er äußerst radikal die Fragestellung selbst verlagert. Auf dieser Grundlage wird ferner der Freiheitsbegriff Hegels neu gefaßt, und zwar besonders im Hinblick auf seine verdeckte, aber allesentscheidende Funktion in der Dialektik der Idee des Guten. Freiheit ist noch etwas anderes als Autonomie, Sich-Wiederfinden im Anderen usw. Sie tritt in der Dialektik des Guten als Mittelbegriff einer logischen (d. h. notwendigen) Vermittlung auf und erweist so ihre Irreduktibilität. Dies gibt Anlaß zu einer Reinterpretation der Hegelschen Religionsphilosophie. Weder Apologie der bestehenden Religionen noch agnostische Kritik, zeigt sich "das Religiöse" vielmehr als der Grundzug einer gewissen Form der Menschlichkeit, in Bezug auf die die Frage erörtert wird, bis zu welchem Grade sie etwa datiert ("überholt") sei.},

The appearance of pitch hierarchies is common to both approaches and thus provides a starting point for the discussion. There are two other theoretical aspects, which motivate the comparison between the two approaches: (a) the distinction between generic and specific intervals and (b) the duality between step interval patterns and fifth/fourth foldings in the theory of well-formed modes.},

We measure Pearson correlations in the constant-Q transform (CQT) domain to build a K-nearest neighbor graph between frequency subbands. Then, we run the Isomap manifold learning algorithm to represent this graph in a three-dimensional space in which straight lines approximate graph geodesics. Experiments on isolated musical notes demonstrate that the resulting manifold resembles a helix which makes a full turn at every octave. A circular shape is also found in English speech, but not in urban noise. We discuss the impact of various design choices on the visualization: instrumentarium, loudness mapping function, and number of neighbors K.},

In perception, these dimensions are referred to as pitch height and pitch chroma, respectively. Pitch chroma provides a basis for presenting acoustic patterns (melodies) that do not depend on the particular sound source. In contrast, pitch height provides a basis for segregation of notes into streams to separate sound sources. This paper reports a functional magnetic resonance experiment designed to search for distinct mappings of these two types of pitch change in the human brain. The results show that chroma change is specifically represented anterior to primary auditory cortex, whereas height change is specifically represented posterior to primary auditory cortex. We propose that tracking of acoustic information streams occurs in anterior auditory areas, whereas the segregation of sound objects (a crucial aspect of auditory scene analysis) depends on posterior areas.},

The human brain confronts the same problem in everyday perception, extracting from its high-dimensional sensory inputs—30,000 auditory nerve fibers or 106 optic nerve fibers—a manageably small number of perceptually relevant features. Here we describe an approach to solving dimensionality reduction problems that uses easily measured local metric information to learn the underlying global geometry of a data set. Unlike classical techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and multidimensional scaling (MDS), our approach is capable of discovering the nonlinear degrees of freedom that underlie complex natural observations, such as human handwriting or images of a face under different viewing conditions. In contrast to previous algorithms for nonlinear dimensionality reduction, ours efficiently computes a globally optimal solution, and, for an important class of data manifolds, is guaranteed to converge asymptotically to the true structure.},

This work surveys and extends recent research which demonstrates that randomization offers a powerful tool for performing low-rank matrix approximation. These techniques exploit modern computational architectures more fully than classical methods and open the possibility of dealing with truly massive data sets. This paper presents a modular framework for constructing randomized algorithms that compute partial matrix decompositions. These methods use random sampling to identify a subspace that captures most of the action of a matrix. The input matrix is then compressed---either explicitly or implicitly---to this subspace, and the reduced matrix is manipulated deterministically to obtain the desired low-rank factorization. In many cases, this approach beats its classical competitors in terms of accuracy, speed, and robustness.

In this paper, we introduce a new key-finding algorithm that can be applied to music in both symbolic and audio formats. The algorithm, which is based on a Hidden Markov Model (HMM), provides two stages of key-finding output; the first one referring to local keys and the second one to the global key.  We describe the input, the two output stages, and the parameters of the model. In particular, we describe two configurable parameters, the transition probability distributions, which are based on a matrix of neighbouring keys, and the emission probability distributions, which make use of established key profiles.  We discuss the local key-finding capabilities of the algorithm, presenting an example analysis of the Prelude Op. 28 No. 20 in C minor by Chopin, showing the local key regions obtained using different key profiles. We evaluate the global key-finding capabilities of the model, using an existing dataset and six well-known key profiles as different model parameters.  Since different key profiles will tend to err or misclassify in different ways and across different pieces, we train an ensemble method with the predictions from all the key profiles (6) through our model. We show that the ensemble method achieves state-of-the-art performance for major and overall keys, however, it still underperforms the state-of-the-art for minor keys.},

Statistical mechanical analyses have revealed that natural language text is characterized by scaling properties, which quantify the global structure in the vocabulary population and the long memory of a text. We study whether five scaling properties (given by Zipf’s law, Heaps’ law, Ebeling’s method, Taylor’s law, and long-range correlation analysis) can serve for evaluation of computational models. Specifically, we test n-gram language models, a probabilistic context-free grammar, language models based on Simon/Pitman-Yor processes, neural language models, and generative adversarial networks for text generation. Our analysis reveals that language models based on recurrent neural networks with a gating mechanism (i.e., long short-term memory; a gated recurrent unit; and quasi-recurrent neural networks) are the only computational models that can reproduce the long memory behavior of natural language. Furthermore, through comparison with recently proposed model-based evaluation methods, we find that the exponent of Taylor’s law is a good indicator of model quality.},

In other words, each component of the representation is a linear combination of the original variables. Well-known linear transformation methods include principal component analysis, factor analysis, and projection pursuit. Independent component analysis (ICA) is a recently developed method in which the goal is to ﬁnd a linear representation of nongaussian data so that the components are statistically independent, or as independent as possible. Such a representation seems to capture the essential structure of the data in many applications, including feature extraction and signal separation. In this paper, we present the basic theory and applications of ICA, and our recent work on the subject.},

	abstract = {Whitening, or sphering, is a common preprocessing step in statistical analysis to transform random variables to orthogonality. However, due to rotational freedom there are infinitely many possible whitening procedures. Consequently, there is a diverse range of sphering methods in use, for example based on principal component analysis (PCA), Cholesky matrix decomposition and zero-phase component analysis (ZCA), among others. Here we provide an overview of the underlying theory and discuss five natural whitening procedures. Subsequently, we demonstrate that investigating the cross-covariance and the cross-correlation matrix between sphered and original variables allows to break the rotational invariance and to identify optimal whitening transformations. As a result we recommend two particular approaches: ZCA-cor whitening to produce sphered variables that are maximally similar to the original variables, and PCA-cor whitening to obtain sphered variables that maximally compress the original variables.},

	abstract = {For centuries, music has been shared and remembered by two traditions: aural transmission and in the form of written documents normally called musical scores. Many of these scores exist in the form of unpublished manuscripts and hence they are in danger of being lost through the normal ravages of time. To preserve the music some form of typesetting or, ideally, a computer system that can automatically decode the symbolic images and create new scores is required. Programs analogous to optical character recognition systems called optical music recognition (OMR) systems have been under intensive development for many years. However, the results to date are far from ideal. Each of the proposed methods emphasizes different properties and therefore makes it difficult to effectively evaluate its competitive advantages. This article provides an overview of the literature concerning the automatic analysis of images of printed and handwritten musical scores. For self-containment and for the benefit of the reader, an introduction to OMR processing systems precedes the literature overview. The following study presents a reference scheme for any researcher wanting to compare new OMR algorithms against well-known ones.},

	abstract = {For over 50 years, researchers have been trying to teach computers to read music notation, referred to as Optical Music Recognition (OMR). However, this field is still difficult to access for new researchers, especially those without a significant musical background: few introductory materials are available, and furthermore the field has struggled with defining itself and building a shared terminology. In this tutorial, we address these shortcomings by (1) providing a robust definition of OMR and its relationship to related fields, (2) analyzing how OMR inverts the music encoding process to recover the musical notation and the musical semantics from documents, (3) proposing a taxonomy of OMR, with most notably a novel taxonomy of applications. Additionally, we discuss how deep learning affects modern OMR research, as opposed to the traditional pipeline. Based on this work, the reader should be able to attain a basic understanding of OMR: its objectives, its inherent structure, its relationship to other fields, the state of the art, and the research opportunities it affords.},
